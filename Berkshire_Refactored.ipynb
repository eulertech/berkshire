The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.\\n</p>\\n<p>3\\n</p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 1998 was $25.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class\\nA and Class B stock by 48.3%.  Over the last 34 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share book value\\nhas grown from $19 to $37,801, a rate of 24.7% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>Normally, a gain of 48.3% would call for handsprings \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but not this year.  Remember Wagner, whose music\\nhas been described as better than it sounds?  Well, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress in 1998 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though more than satisfactory \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was not\\nas good as it looks.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because most of that 48.3% gain came from our issuing shares in acquisitions.\\n</p>\\n<p>To explain: Our stock sells at a large premium over book value, which means that any issuing of shares we do\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether for cash or as consideration in a merger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 instantly increases our per-share book-value figure, even though\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve earned not a dime.  What happens is that we get more per-share book value in such transactions than we give up.\\nThese transactions, however, do not deliver us any immediate gain in per-share intrinsic value, because in this respect\\nwhat we give and what we get are roughly equal.  And, as Charlie Munger, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vice Chairman and my partner,\\nand I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you too often (though you may feel that we try), it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the per-share gain in intrinsic value that counts rather\\nthan the per-share gain in book value.  Though Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value grew very substantially in 1998, the gain fell\\nwell short of the 48.3% recorded for book value.  Nevertheless, intrinsic value still far exceeds book value.  (For a more\\nextensive discussion of these terms, and other investment and accounting concepts, please refer to our Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual,\\non pages 56-64, in which we set forth our owner-related business principles.  Intrinsic value is discussed on pages 61 and\\n62.)\\n</p>\\n<p>We entered 1999 with the best collection of businesses and managers in our history.  The two companies we\\nacquired in 1998, General Re and Executive Jet, are first-class in every way \\xe2\\x80\\x94 more about both later \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the\\nperformance of our operating businesses last year exceeded my hopes.  GEICO, once again, simply shot the lights out.\\nOn the minus side, several of the public companies in which we have major investments experienced significant operating\\nshortfalls that neither they nor I  anticipated early in the year.  Consequently, our equity portfolio did not perform nearly\\nas well as did the S&amp;P 500.  The problems of these companies are almost certainly temporary, and Charlie and I believe\\nthat their long-term prospects are excellent.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our last three annual reports, we furnished you a table that we regard as central to estimating Berkshire\\'s\\nintrinsic value.  In the updated version of that table, which follows, we trace our two key components of value, including\\nGeneral Re on a pro-forma basis as if we had owned it throughout the year.  The first column lists our per-share\\nownership of investments (including cash and equivalents but excluding securities held in our financial products\\noperation) and the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire\\'s operating businesses before taxes and\\npurchase-accounting adjustments (discussed on pages 62 and 63), but after all interest and corporate expenses.  The\\nsecond column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the investments presented in the\\nfirst column.  In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would look if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding\\nour investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

General Re (included, as noted, on a pro-forma basis) explains both facts.  This company has very large\\ninvestments, and these greatly increased our per-share investment figure.  But General Re also had an underwriting loss\\nin 1998, and that hurt operating earnings.  Had we not acquired General Re, per-share operating earnings would have\\nshown a modest gain.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though certain of our acquisitions and operating strategies may from time to time affect one column more than the\\nother, we continually work to increase the figures in both.  But one thing is certain: Our future rates of gain will fall far\\nshort of those achieved in the past.  Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital base is now simply too large to allow us to earn truly outsized\\nreturns.  If you believe otherwise, you should consider a career in sales but avoid one in mathematics (bearing in mind\\nthat there are really only three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t).\\n</p>\\n<p>Currently we are working to compound a net worth of $57.4 billion, the largest of any American corporation\\n(though our figure will be eclipsed if the merger of Exxon and Mobil takes place).  Of course, our lead in net worth  does\\nnot mean that Berkshire outranks all other businesses in value: Market value is what counts for owners and General\\nElectric and Microsoft, for example, have valuations more than three times Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  Net worth, though,  measures\\nthe capital that managers must deploy, and at Berkshire that figure has indeed become huge.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nonetheless, Charlie and I will do our best to increase intrinsic value in the future at an average rate of 15%, a\\nresult we consider to be at the very peak of possible outcomes.  We may have years when we exceed 15%, but we will\\nmost certainly have other years when we fall far short of that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including years showing negative returns \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and those\\nwill bring our average down.  In the meantime, you should understand just what an average gain of 15% over the next\\nfive years implies: It means we will need to increase net worth by $58 billion.  Earning this daunting 15% will require\\nus to come up with big ideas: Popcorn stands just won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do.  Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s markets are not friendly to our search for\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9celephants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but you can be sure that we will stay  focused on the hunt.\\n</p>\\n<p>Whatever the future holds, I make you one promise: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep at least 99% of my net worth in Berkshire for as long\\nas I am around.  How long will that be?  My model is the loyal Democrat in Fort Wayne who asked to be buried in\\nChicago so that he could stay active in the party.  To that end, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already selected a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpower spot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the office for my\\nurn.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Our financial growth has been matched by employment growth: We now have 47,566 on our payroll, with the\\nacquisitions of 1998 bringing 7,074 employees to us and internal growth adding another 2,500.  To balance this gain </p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>5\\n</p>\\n<p>of 9,500 in hands-on employees, we have enlarged the staff at world headquarters from 12 to 12.8.  (The .8 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t refer\\nto me or Charlie:  We have a new person in accounting, working four days a week.)  Despite this alarming trend toward\\ncorporate bloat, our after-tax overhead last year was about $3.5 million, or well under  one basis point (.01 of 1%) of the\\nvalue of the assets we manage.\\n</p>\\n<p>Taxes\\n</p>\\n<p>One beneficiary of our increased size has been the U.S. Treasury.  The federal income taxes that Berkshire and\\nGeneral Re have paid, or will soon pay, in respect to 1998 earnings total $2.7 billion.  That means we shouldered all of\\nthe U.S. Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expenses for more than a half-day.\\n</p>\\n<p>Follow that thought a little further: If only 625 other U.S. taxpayers had paid the Treasury as much as we and\\nGeneral Re did last year, no one else \\xe2\\x80\\x94 neither corporations nor 270 million citizens \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would have had to pay federal\\nincome taxes or any other kind of federal tax (for example, social security or estate taxes).  Our shareholders can truly\\nsay that they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgave at the office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Writing checks to the IRS that include strings of zeros does not bother Charlie or me.  Berkshire as a corporation,\\nand we as individuals, have prospered in America as we would have in no other country.  Indeed, if we lived in some\\nother part of the world and completely escaped taxes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure we would be worse off financially (and in many other ways\\nas well).  Overall, we feel extraordinarily lucky to have been dealt a hand in life that enables us to write large checks to\\nthe government rather than one requiring the government to regularly write checks to us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 say, because we are disabled\\nor unemployed.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax situation is sometimes misunderstood.  First, capital gains have no special attraction for us: A\\ncorporation pays a 35% rate on taxable income, whether it comes from capital gains or from ordinary operations.  This\\nmeans that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax on a long-term capital gain is fully 75% higher than what an individual would pay on an\\nidentical gain.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some people harbor another misconception, believing that we can exclude 70% of all dividends we receive from\\nour taxable income.  Indeed, the 70% rate applies to most corporations and also applies to Berkshire in cases where we\\nhold stocks in non-insurance subsidiaries.  However, almost all of our equity investments are owned by  our insurance\\ncompanies, and in that case the exclusion is 59.5%.  That still means a dollar of dividends is considerably more valuable\\nto us than a dollar of ordinary income, but not to the degree often assumed.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire truly went all out for the Treasury last year.  In connection with the General Re merger, we wrote a $30\\nmillion check to the government to pay an SEC fee tied to the new shares created by the deal.  We understand that this\\npayment set an SEC record.  Charlie and I are enormous admirers of what the Commission has accomplished for\\nAmerican investors.  We would rather, however, have found another way to show our admiration.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO (1-800-847-7536)\\n</p>\\n<p>Combine a great idea with a great manager and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re certain to obtain a great result.  That mix is alive and well\\nat GEICO.  The idea is low-cost auto insurance, made possible by direct-to-customer marketing, and the manager is Tony\\nNicely.  Quite simply, there is no one in the business world who could run GEICO better than Tony does.  His instincts\\nare unerring, his energy is boundless, and his execution is flawless.  While maintaining underwriting discipline, Tony\\nis building an organization that is gaining market share at an accelerating rate.\\n</p>\\n<p>This pace has been encouraged by our compensation policies.  The direct writing of insurance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, without\\nthere being an agent or broker between the insurer and its policyholder \\xe2\\x80\\x94 involves a substantial front-end investment.\\nFirst-year business is therefore unprofitable in a major way.  At GEICO, we do not wish this cost to deter our associates\\nfrom the aggressive pursuit of new business \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, as it renews, will deliver significant profits  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so we leave it out\\nof our compensation formulas.

The effects\\nthat these efforts had at the company are shown by the new business and in-force figures below:\\n</p>\\n<p>New Auto Auto Policies\\nYears       Policies*         In-Force*\\n</p>\\n<p>1993 1,354,882 2,011,055\\n1994 1,396,217 2,147,549\\n1995 1,461,608 2,310,037\\n1996 1,617,669 2,543,699\\n1997 1,913,176 2,949,439\\n1998 1,317,761 3,562,644\\n</p>\\n<p>* \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVoluntary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d only; excludes assigned risks and the like.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1999, we will again increase our marketing budget, spending at least $190 million.  In fact, there is no limit to\\nwhat Berkshire is willing to invest in GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new-business activity, as long as we can concurrently build the\\ninfrastructure the company needs to properly serve its policyholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Because of the first-year costs, companies that are concerned about quarterly or annual earnings would shy from\\nsimilar investments, no matter how intelligent these might be in terms of building long-term value.  Our calculus is\\ndifferent: We simply measure whether we are creating more than a dollar of value per dollar spent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and if that\\ncalculation is favorable, the more dollars we spend the happier I am.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is far more to GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success, of course, than low prices and a torrent of advertising.  The handling of\\nclaims must also be fair, fast and friendly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and ours is.  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an impartial scorecard on how we shape up: In New\\nYork, our largest-volume state, the Insurance Department recently reported that GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint ratio in 1997 was\\nnot only the lowest of the five largest auto insurers but was also less than half the average of the other four.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1998 profit margin of 6.7% was better than we had anticipated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, indeed, better than we wished.\\nOur results reflect an industry-wide phenomenon: In recent years, both the frequency of auto accidents and their severity\\nhave unexpectedly declined.  We responded by reducing rates 3.3% in 1998, and we will reduce them still more in 1999.\\nThese moves will soon bring profit margins down \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at the least to 4%, which is our target, and perhaps considerably\\nlower.  Whatever the case, we believe that our margins will continue to be much better than those of the industry.\\n</p>\\n<p>With GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth and profitability both outstanding in 1998, so also were its profit-sharing and bonus\\npayments.  Indeed, the profit-sharing payment of $103 million or 32.3% of salary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which went to all 9,313 associates\\nwho had been with us for more than a year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 may well have been the highest percentage payment at any large company\\nin the country.  (In addition, associates benefit from a company-funded pension plan.)\\n</p>\\n<p>The 32.3% may turn out to be a high-water mark, given that the profitability component in our profit-sharing\\ncalculation is almost certain to come down in the future.  The growth component, though,  may well increase.  Overall,\\nwe expect the two benchmarks together to dictate very significant profit-sharing payments for decades to come.  For our\\nassociates, growth pays off in other ways as well: Last year we promoted 4,612 people.\\n</p>\\n<p>Impressive as the GEICO figures are, we have far more to do.  Our market share improved significantly in 1998\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but only from 3% to 3\\xc2\\xbd%.  For every policyholder we now have, there are another ten who should be giving us their\\nbusiness.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some of you who are reading this may be in that category.  About 40% of those who check our rates find that they\\ncan save money by doing business with us.  The proportion is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting\\njudgements, with some giving more credit than we do to drivers who live in certain geographical areas or work at certain\\noccupations.  We believe, however, that we more frequently offer the low price than does any other national carrier</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

So give us a call and check us out.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>You may think that one commercial in this section is enough.  But I have another to present, this one directed at\\nmanagers of publicly-owned companies.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire we feel that telling outstanding CEOs, such as Tony, how to run their companies would be the height\\nof foolishness.  Most of our managers wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for us if they got a lot of backseat driving.   (Generally, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nhave to work for anyone, since 75% or so are independently wealthy.)  Besides, they are the Mark McGwires of the\\nbusiness world and need no advice from us as to how to hold the bat or when to swing.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership may make even the best of managers more effective.  First, we eliminate all\\nof the ritualistic and nonproductive activities that normally go with the job of CEO.  Our managers are totally in charge\\nof their personal schedules.  Second, we give each a simple mission: Just run your business as if: 1) you own 100% of\\nit; 2) it is the only asset in the world that you and your family have or will ever have; and 3) you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sell or merge it\\nfor at least a century.  As a corollary, we tell them they should not let any of their decisions be affected even slightly by\\naccounting considerations.  We want our managers to think about what counts, not how it will be counted.\\n</p>\\n<p>Very few CEOs of public companies operate under a similar mandate, mainly because they have owners who focus\\non short-term prospects and reported earnings.  Berkshire, however, has a shareholder base \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which it will have for\\ndecades to come \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that has the longest investment horizon to be found in the public-company universe.  Indeed, a\\nmajority of our shares are held by investors who expect to die still holding them.  We can therefore ask our CEOs to\\nmanage for maximum long-term value, rather than for next quarter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings.  We certainly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ignore the current\\nresults of our businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in most cases, they are of great importance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but we never want them to be achieved at the\\nexpense of our building ever-greater competitive strengths.\\n</p>\\n<p>I believe the GEICO story demonstrates the benefits of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach.  Charlie and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taught Tony\\na thing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and never will \\xe2\\x80\\x94  but we have created an environment that allows him to apply all of his talents to what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nimportant.  He does not have to devote his time or energy to board meetings, press interviews, presentations by investment\\nbankers or talks with financial analysts.  Furthermore, he need never spend a moment thinking about financing, credit\\nratings or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStreet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expectations for earnings per share.  Because of our ownership structure, he also knows that this\\noperational framework will endure for decades to come.  In this environment of freedom, both Tony and his company\\ncan convert their almost limitless potential into matching achievements.\\n</p>\\n<p>If you are running a large, profitable business that will thrive in a GEICO-like environment, check our acquisition\\ncriteria on page 21 and give me a call.  I promise a fast answer and will mention your inquiry to no one except\\nCharlie.\\n</p>\\n<p>Executive Jet Aviation (1-800-848-6436)\\n</p>\\n<p>To understand the huge potential at Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), you need some understanding of its business,\\nwhich is selling fractional shares of jets and operating the fleet for its many owners.  Rich Santulli, CEO of EJA, created\\nthe fractional ownership industry in 1986, by visualizing an important new way of using planes.  Then he combined guts\\nand talent to turn his idea into a major business.\\n</p>\\n<p>In a fractional ownership plan, you purchase a portion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 say /8th \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of any of a wide variety of jets that EJA1\\n</p>\\n<p>offers.  That purchase entitles you to 100 hours of flying time annually.  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDead-head\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hours don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count against your\\nallotment, and you are also allowed to average your hours over five years.)  In addition, you pay both a monthly\\nmanagement fee and a fee for hours actually flown.\\n</p>\\n<p>Then, on a few hours notice, EJA makes your plane, or another at least as good, available to you at your choice of\\nthe 5500 airports in the U.S.  In effect, calling up your plane is like phoning for a taxi. </p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>8\\n</p>\\n<p>I first heard about the NetJets\\xc2\\xae program, as it is called, about four years ago from Frank Rooney, our manager at\\nH.H. Brown.  Frank had used and been delighted with the service and suggested that I meet Rich to investigate signing\\nup for my family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use.  It took Rich about 15 minutes to sell me a quarter (200 hours annually) of a Hawker 1000.  Since\\nthen, my family has learned firsthand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 through flying 900 hours on 300 trips \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what a friendly, efficient, and safe\\noperation EJA runs.  Quite simply, they love this service.  In fact, they quickly grew so enthusiastic  that I did a\\ntestimonial ad for EJA long before I knew there was any possibility of our purchasing the business.  I did, however, ask\\nRich to give me a call if he ever got interested in selling.  Luckily, he phoned me last May, and we quickly made a $725\\nmillion deal, paying equal amounts of cash and stock.\\n</p>\\n<p>EJA, which is by far the largest operator in its industry, has more than 1,000 customers and 163 aircraft (including\\n23 \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccore\\xe2\\x80\\x9d aircraft that are owned or leased by EJA itself, so that it can make sure that service is first-class even during\\nthe times when demand is heaviest).  Safety, of course, is the paramount issue in any flight operation, and Rich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pilots\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 now numbering about 650 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 receive extensive training at least twice a year from FlightSafety International, another\\nBerkshire subsidiary and the world leader in pilot training.  The bottom line on our pilots: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sold the Berkshire plane\\nand will now do all of my business flying, as well as my personal flying, with NetJets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 crews.\\n</p>\\n<p>Being the leader in this industry is a major advantage for all concerned.  Our customers gain because we have an\\narmada of planes positioned throughout the country at all times, a blanketing that allows us to provide unmatched service.\\nMeanwhile, we gain from the blanketing because it reduces dead-head costs.  Another compelling attraction for our\\nclients is that we offer products from Boeing, Gulfstream, Falcon, Cessna, and Raytheon, whereas our two competitors\\nare owned by manufacturers that offer only their own planes.  In effect, NetJets is like a physician who can recommend\\nwhatever medicine best fits the needs of each patient; our competitors, in contrast, are producers of  a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chouse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d brand that\\nthey must prescribe for one and all.\\n</p>\\n<p>In many cases our clients, both corporate and individual, own fractions of several different planes and can therefore\\nmatch specific planes to specific missions.  For example, a client might own /16th of three different jets (each giving it1\\n</p>\\n<p>50 hours of flying time), which in total give it a virtual fleet, obtained for a small fraction of the cost of a single plane.\\n</p>\\n<p>Significantly, it is not only small businesses that can benefit from fractional ownership.  Already, some of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlargest companies use NetJets as a supplement to their own fleet.  This saves them big money in both meeting peak\\nrequirements and in flying missions that would require their wholly-owned planes to log a disproportionate amount of\\ndead-head hours.\\n</p>\\n<p>When a plane is slated for personal use, the clinching argument is that either the client signs up now or his children\\nlikely will later.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an equation I explained to my wonderful Aunt Alice 40 years ago when she asked me whether\\nshe could afford a fur coat.  My reply settled the issue: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlice, you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buying it; your heirs are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>EJA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth has been explosive: In 1997, it accounted for 31% of all corporate jets ordered in the world.\\nNonetheless, Rich and I believe that the potential of fractional ownership has barely been scratched.  If many thousands\\nof owners find it sensible to own 100% of a plane \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which must be used 350-400 hours annually if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  to make\\neconomic sense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there must be a large multiple of that number for whom fractional ownership works.\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition to being a terrific executive, Rich is fun.  Like most of our managers, he has no economic need\\nwhatsoever to work.  Rich spends his time at EJA because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his baby \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he wants to see how far he can take it.\\nWe both already know the answer, both literally and figuratively: to the ends of the earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>And now a small hint to Berkshire directors: Last year I spent more than nine times my salary at Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and\\nEJA.

       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>9\\n</p>\\n<p>General Re\\n</p>\\n<p>On December 21, we completed our $22 billion acquisition of General Re Corp.  In addition to owning 100% of\\nGeneral Reinsurance Corporation, the largest U.S. property-casualty reinsurer, the company also owns (including stock\\nit has an arrangement to buy) 82% of the oldest reinsurance company in the world, Cologne Re.  The two companies\\ntogether reinsure all lines of insurance and operate in 124 countries.\\n</p>\\n<p>For many decades, General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name has stood for quality, integrity and professionalism in reinsurance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and\\nunder Ron Ferguson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, this reputation has been burnished still more.  Berkshire can add absolutely nothing\\nto the skills of General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Cologne Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers.  On the contrary, there is a lot that they can teach us.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, we believe that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership will benefit General Re in important ways and that its earnings\\na decade from now will materially exceed those that would have been attainable absent the merger.  We base this\\noptimism on the fact that we can offer General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management a freedom to operate in whatever manner will best allow\\nthe company to exploit its strengths.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look for a moment at the reinsurance business to understand why General Re could not on its own do what\\nit can under Berkshire.  Most of the demand for reinsurance comes from primary insurers who want to escape  the wide\\nswings in earnings that result from large and unusual losses.  In effect, a reinsurer gets paid for absorbing the  volatility\\nthat the client insurer wants to shed.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ironically, though, a publicly-held reinsurer gets graded by both its owners and those who evaluate its credit on the\\nsmoothness of its own results.  Wide swings in earnings hurt both credit ratings and p/e ratios, even when the business\\nthat produces such swings has an expectancy of satisfactory profits over time.  This market reality sometimes causes a\\nreinsurer to make costly moves, among them laying off a significant portion of the business it writes (in transactions that\\nare called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cretrocessions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) or rejecting good business simply because it threatens to bring on too much volatility.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire, in contrast, happily accepts volatility, just as long as it carries with it the expectation of increased  profits\\nover time.  Furthermore, we are a Fort Knox of capital, and that means volatile earnings can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impair our premier credit\\nratings.  Thus we have the perfect structure for writing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and retaining \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reinsurance in virtually any amount.  In fact,\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used this strength over the past decade to build a powerful super-cat business.\\n</p>\\n<p>What General Re gives us, however, is the distribution force, technical facilities and management that will allow\\nus to employ our structural strength in every facet of the industry.  In particular, General Re and Cologne Re can now\\naccelerate their push into international markets, where the preponderance of industry growth will almost certainly occur.\\nAs the merger proxy statement spelled out, Berkshire also brings tax and investment benefits to General Re.  But the most\\ncompelling reason for the merger is simply that General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outstanding management can now do what it does best,\\nunfettered by the constraints that have limited its growth.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire is assuming responsibility for General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment portfolio, though not for Cologne Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  We will\\nnot, however, be involved in General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting.  We will simply ask the company to exercise the discipline of\\nthe past while increasing the proportion of its business that is retained, expanding its product line, and widening its\\ngeographical coverage \\xe2\\x80\\x94 making these moves in recognition of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial strength and tolerance for wide\\nswings in earnings.  As we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve long said, we prefer a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, Ron and his team will maximize General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new potential.  He and I have known each other for\\nmany years, and each of our companies has initiated significant business that it has reinsured with the other.  Indeed,\\nGeneral Re played a key role in the resuscitation of GEICO from its near-death status in 1976.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both Ron and Rich Santulli plan to be at the annual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to say hello to them.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>10\\n</p>\\n<p>The Economics of Property-Casualty Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>With the acquisition of General Re \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and with GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business mushrooming \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it becomes more important than ever\\nthat you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the\\nbusiness generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most important of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.\\n</p>\\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are\\nreceived before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests\\nthe money.  Typically, this pleasant activity carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually\\ndo not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which is the\\ncost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would\\notherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\\n</p>\\n<p>A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring\\ntheir underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company\\'s true cost of float.  Errors\\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly\\ninto earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can\\ntypically do no more than accept what\\'s presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name\\nauditors have implicitly blessed.  As for Berkshire, Charlie and I attempt to be conservative in presenting its underwriting\\nresults to you, because we have found that virtually all surprises in insurance are unpleasant ones.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table that follows shows the float generated by Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance operations since we entered the business\\n32 years ago.  The data are for every fifth year and also the last, which includes General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge float.  For the table\\nwe have calculated our float \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by adding net\\nloss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then\\nsubtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed\\nreinsurance.  (Got that?)\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Average Float\\n(in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1967    17\\n1972    70\\n1977   139\\n1982   221\\n1987 1,267\\n1992 2,290\\n1997 7,093\\n</p>\\n<p>1998              22,762 (yearend)\\n</p>\\n<p>Impressive as the growth in our float has been \\xe2\\x80\\x94 25.4% compounded annually \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what really counts is the cost\\nof this item.  If that becomes too high, growth in float becomes a curse rather than a blessing.  \\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, the news is all good: Our average cost over the 32 years has been well under zero.  In aggregate, we\\nhave posted a substantial underwriting profit, which means that we have been paid for holding a large and growing\\namount of money.  This is the best of all worlds.  Indeed, though our net float is recorded on our balance sheet as a\\nliability, it has had more economic value to us than an equal amount of net worth would have had.  As long as we can\\ncontinue to achieve an underwriting profit, float will continue to outrank net worth in value.\\n</p>\\n<p>During the next few years, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth in float may well be modest.  The reinsurance market is soft, and\\nin this business, relationships change slowly.  Therefore, General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float \\xe2\\x80\\x94 /3rds of our total \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is unlikely to2\\n</p>\\n<p>increase significantly in the near term.  We do expect, however, that our cost of float will remain very attractive compared\\nto that of other insurers.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

In particular, my decision to sell McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was a very big mistake.  Overall, you would have\\nbeen better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the movies during market hours.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>13\\n</p>\\n<p>At yearend, we held more than $15 billion in cash equivalents (including high-grade securities due in less\\nthan one year).  Cash never makes us happy.  But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better to have the money burning a hole in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npocket than resting comfortably in someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  Charlie and I will continue our search for large equity\\ninvestments or, better yet, a really major business acquisition that would absorb our liquid assets.  Currently,\\nhowever, we see nothing on the horizon.\\n</p>\\n<p>Once we knew that the General Re merger would definitely take place, we asked the company to dispose of\\nthe equities that it held.  (As mentioned earlier, we do not manage the Cologne Re portfolio, which includes many\\nequities.)  General Re subsequently eliminated its positions in about 250 common stocks, incurring $935 million\\nof taxes in the process.  This \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclean sweep\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach reflects a basic principle that Charlie and I employ in\\nbusiness and investing: We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t back into decisions.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year I deviated from my standard practice of not disclosing our investments (other than those we are\\nlegally required to report) and told you about three unconventional investments we had made.  There were several\\nreasons behind that disclosure.  First, questions about our silver position that we had received from regulatory\\nauthorities led us to believe that they wished us to publicly acknowledge this investment.  Second, our holdings\\nof zero-coupon bonds were so large that we wanted our owners to know of this investment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential impact on\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net worth.  Third, we simply wanted to alert you to the fact that we sometimes do make unconventional\\ncommitments.\\n</p>\\n<p>Normally, however, as discussed in the Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual on page 61, we see no advantage in talking about\\nspecific investment actions.  Therefore \\xe2\\x80\\x94 unless we again take a position that is particularly large \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we will not\\npost you as to what we are doing in respect to any specific holding of an unconventional sort.  We can report,\\nhowever, that we have eliminated certain of the positions discussed last year and added certain others.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our never-comment-even-if-untrue policy in regard to investments may disappoint \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpiggybackers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but will\\nbenefit owners: Your Berkshire shares would be worth less if we discussed what we are doing.  Incidentally, we\\nshould warn you that media speculation about our investment moves continues in most cases to be incorrect.\\nPeople who rely on such commentary do so at their own peril.\\n</p>\\n<p>Accounting \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Part 1\\n</p>\\n<p>Our General Re acquisition put a spotlight on an egregious flaw in accounting procedure.  Sharp-eyed\\nshareholders reading our proxy statement probably noticed an unusual item on page 60.  In the pro-forma\\nstatement of income \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which detailed how the combined 1997 earnings of the two entities would have been\\naffected by the merger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there was an item stating that compensation expense would have been increased by $63\\nmillion.\\n</p>\\n<p>This item, we hasten to add, does not signal that either Charlie or I have experienced a major personality\\nchange.  (He still travels coach and quotes Ben Franklin.)  Nor does it indicate any shortcoming in General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\naccounting practices, which have followed GAAP to the letter.  Instead, the pro-forma adjustment came about\\nbecause we are replacing General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longstanding stock option plan with a cash plan that ties the incentive\\ncompensation of General Re managers to their operating achievements.  Formerly what counted for these managers\\nwas General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price; now their payoff will come from the business performance they deliver.\\n</p>\\n<p>The new plan and the terminated option arrangement have matching economics, which means that the rewards\\nthey deliver to employees should, for a given level of performance, be the same.  But what these people could have\\nformerly anticipated earning from new option grants will now be paid in cash.  (Options granted in past years\\nremain outstanding.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Though the two plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different\\naccounting result.  This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost\\nof stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a\\ngreat many corporations.  In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form\\nand count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost.  Small wonder then that the use of options</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>14\\n</p>\\n<p>has mushroomed.  This lop-sided choice has a big downside for owners, however: Though options, if properly\\nstructured, can be an appropriate, and even ideal, way to compensate and motivate top managers, they are more\\noften wildly capricious in their distribution of rewards, inefficient as motivators, and inordinately expensive for\\nshareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Whatever the merits of options may be, their accounting treatment is outrageous.  Think for a moment of that\\n$190 million we are going to spend for advertising at GEICO this year.  Suppose that instead of paying cash for\\nour ads, we paid the media in ten-year, at-the-market Berkshire options.  Would anyone then care to argue\\nthat Berkshire had not borne a cost for advertising, or should not be charged this cost on its books?\\n</p>\\n<p>Perhaps Bishop Berkeley \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you may remember him as the philosopher who mused about trees falling in a\\nforest when no one was around \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would believe that an expense unseen by an accountant does not exist.  Charlie\\nand I, however, have trouble being philosophical about unrecorded costs.  When we consider investing in an option-\\nissuing company, we make an appropriate downward adjustment to reported earnings, simply subtracting an amount\\nequal to what the company could have realized by publicly selling options of like quantity and structure.  Similarly,\\nif we contemplate an acquisition, we include in our evaluation the cost of replacing any option plan.  Then, if we\\nmake a deal, we promptly take that cost out of hiding.\\n</p>\\n<p>Readers who disagree with me about options will by this time be mentally quarreling with my equating the\\ncost of options issued to employees with those that might theoretically be sold and traded publicly.  It is true, to\\nstate one of these arguments, that employee options are sometimes forfeited \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that lessens the damage done to\\nshareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whereas publicly-offered options would not be.  It is true, also, that companies receive a tax\\ndeduction when employee options are exercised; publicly-traded options deliver no such benefit.  But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an\\noffset to these points: Options issued to employees are often repriced, a transformation that makes them much more\\ncostly than the public variety.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sometimes argued that a non-transferable option given to an employee is less valuable to him than would\\nbe a publicly-traded option that he could freely sell.  That fact, however, does not reduce the cost of the non-\\ntransferable option: Giving an employee a company car that can only be used for certain purposes diminishes its\\nvalue to the employee, but does not in the least diminish its cost to the employer. \\n</p>\\n<p>The earning revisions that Charlie and I have made for options in recent years have frequently cut the\\nreported per-share figures by 5%, with 10% not all that uncommon.  On occasion, the downward adjustment has\\nbeen so great that it has affected our portfolio decisions, causing us either to make a sale or to pass on a stock\\npurchase we might otherwise have made. \\n</p>\\n<p>A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\noptions aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a form of compensation, what are they?  If compensation isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an expense, what is it?  And, if\\nexpenses shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Accounting \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Part 2\\n</p>\\n<p>The role that managements have played in stock-option accounting has hardly been benign: A distressing\\nnumber of both CEOs and auditors have in recent years bitterly fought FASB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempts to replace option fiction\\nwith truth and virtually none have spoken out in support of FASB.  Its opponents even enlisted Congress in the\\nfight, pushing the case that inflated figures were in the national interest.\\n</p>\\n<p>Still, I believe that the behavior of managements has been even worse when it comes to restructurings and\\nmerger accounting.  Here, many managements purposefully work at manipulating numbers and deceiving investors.\\nAnd, as Michael Kinsley has said about Washington: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe scandal isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s illegal but rather\\nin what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>It was once relatively easy to tell the good guys in accounting from the bad: The late 1960\\'s, for example,\\nbrought on an orgy of what one charlatan dubbed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbold, imaginative accounting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (the practice of which,\\nincidentally, made him loved for a time by Wall Street because he never missed expectations).

       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>15\\n</p>\\n<p>of that period knew who was playing games.  And, to their credit, virtually all of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most-admired\\ncompanies then shunned deception.\\n</p>\\n<p>In recent years, probity has eroded.  Many major corporations still play things straight, but a significant and\\ngrowing number of otherwise high-grade managers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for your\\nchildren or as trustees under your will \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have come to the view that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay to manipulate earnings to satisfy\\nwhat they believe are Wall Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desires.  Indeed, many CEOs think this kind of manipulation is not only okay,\\nbut actually their duty.\\n</p>\\n<p>These managers start with the assumption, all too common, that their job at all times is to encourage the\\nhighest stock price possible (a premise with which we adamantly disagree).  To pump the price, they strive,\\nadmirably, for operational excellence.  But when operations don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t produce the result hoped for, these CEOs resort\\nto unadmirable accounting stratagems.  These either manufacture the desired \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or set the stage for them\\nin the future.\\n</p>\\n<p>Rationalizing this behavior, these managers often say that their shareholders will be hurt if their currency\\nfor doing deals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, their stock \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is not fully-priced, and they also argue that in using accounting\\nshenanigans to get the figures they want, they are only doing what everybody else does.  Once such an\\neverybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-doing-it attitude takes hold, ethical misgivings vanish.  Call this behavior Son of Gresham: Bad\\naccounting drives out good.\\n</p>\\n<p>The distortion du jour is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crestructuring charge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an accounting entry that can, of course, be legitimate\\nbut that too often is a device for manipulating earnings.  In this bit of legerdemain, a large chunk of costs that\\nshould properly be attributed to a number of years is dumped into a single quarter, typically one already fated to\\ndisappoint investors.  In some cases, the purpose of the charge is to clean up earnings misrepresentations of the\\npast, and in others it is to prepare the ground for future misrepresentations.  In either case, the size and timing\\nof these charges is dictated by the cynical proposition that Wall Street will not mind if earnings fall short by $5\\nper share in a given quarter, just as long as this deficiency ensures that quarterly earnings in the future will\\nconsistently exceed expectations by five cents per share.\\n</p>\\n<p>This dump-everything-into-one-quarter behavior suggests a corresponding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbold, imaginative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 golf scores.  In his first round of the season, a golfer should ignore his actual performance and simply fill his\\ncard with atrocious numbers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 double, triple, quadruple bogeys \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then turn in a score of, say, 140.  Having\\nestablished this \\xe2\\x80\\x9creserve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he should go to the golf shop and tell his pro that he wishes to \\xe2\\x80\\x9crestructure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his\\nimperfect swing.  Next, as he takes his new swing onto the course, he should count his good holes, but not the\\nbad ones.  These remnants from his old swing should be charged instead to the reserve established earlier.  At\\nthe end of five rounds, then, his record will be 140, 80, 80, 80, 80 rather than 91, 94, 89, 94, 92.  On Wall\\nStreet, they will ignore the 140 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, after all, came from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscontinued\\xe2\\x80\\x9d swing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and will classify our\\nhero as an 80 shooter (and one who never disappoints).\\n</p>\\n<p>For those who prefer to cheat up front, there would be a variant of this strategy.  The golfer, playing alone\\nwith a cooperative caddy-auditor, should defer the recording of bad holes, take four 80s, accept the plaudits he\\ngets for such athleticism and consistency, and then turn in a fifth card carrying a 140 score.  After rectifying his\\nearlier scorekeeping sins with this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig bath,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he may mumble a few apologies but will refrain from returning\\nthe sums he has previously collected from comparing scorecards in the clubhouse.  (The caddy, need we add, will\\nhave acquired a loyal patron.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, CEOs who use variations of these scoring schemes in real life tend to become addicted to the\\ngames they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re playing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 after all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier to fiddle with the scorecard than to spend hours on the practice tee\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and never muster the will to give them up.

Indeed, at deal time, major auditing firms sometimes point out the possibilities for a\\nlittle accounting magic (or for a lot).

       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>16\\n</p>\\n<p>to third-class tactics.  CEOs understandably do not find it easy to reject auditor-blessed strategies that lead to\\nincreased future \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>An example from the property-casualty insurance industry will illuminate the possibilities.  When a p-c\\ncompany is acquired, the buyer sometimes simultaneously increases its loss reserves, often substantially.  This boost\\nmay merely reflect the previous inadequacy of reserves \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though it is uncanny how often an actuarial \\xe2\\x80\\x9crevelation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nof this kind coincides with the inking of a deal.

In all of our acquisitions, we have left the loss reserve figures exactly\\nas we found them.  After all, we have consistently joined with insurance managers knowledgeable about their\\nbusiness and honest in their financial reporting.  When deals occur in which liabilities are increased immediately\\nand substantially, simple logic says that at least one of those virtues must have been lacking \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or, alternatively,\\nthat the acquirer is laying the groundwork for future infusions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a true story that illustrates an all-too-common view in corporate America.  The CEOs of two large\\nbanks, one of them a man who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d made many acquisitions, were involved not long ago in a friendly merger\\ndiscussion (which in the end didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t produce a deal).  The veteran acquirer was expounding on the merits of the\\npossible combination, only to be skeptically interrupted by the other CEO: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that mean a huge charge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhe asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps as much as $1 billion?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The \\xe2\\x80\\x9csophisticate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wasted no words: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make it bigger than that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing the deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>A preliminary tally by R. G. Associates, of Baltimore, of special charges taken or announced during 1998\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, charges for restructuring, in-process R&amp;D, merger-related items, and write-downs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 identified no less\\nthan 1,369 of these, totaling $72.1 billion.  That is a staggering amount as evidenced by this bit of perspective:\\nThe 1997 earnings of the 500 companies in Fortune\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous list totaled $324 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clearly the attitude of disrespect that many executives have today for accurate reporting is a business\\ndisgrace.  And auditors, as we have already suggested, have done little on the positive side.  Though auditors\\nshould regard the investing public as their client, they tend to kowtow instead to the managers who choose them\\nand dole out their pay.  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>A big piece of news, however, is that the SEC, led by its chairman, Arthur Levitt, seems determined to get\\ncorporate America to clean up its act.  In a landmark speech last September, Levitt called for an end to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\nmanagement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  He correctly observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo many corporate managers, auditors and analysts are participants in\\na game of nods and winks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  And then he laid on a real indictment: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManaging may be giving way to\\nmanipulating; integrity may be losing out to illusion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>I urge you to read the Chairman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech (you can find it on the Internet at www.sec.gov) and to support\\nhim in his efforts to get corporate America to deliver a straight story to its owners.  Levitt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job will be\\nHerculean, but it is hard to think of another more important for him to take on.\\n</p>\\n<p>Reports to Shareholders\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Internet site, www.berkshirehathaway.com, has become a prime source for information about the\\ncompany.  While we continue to send an annual report to all shareholders, we now send quarterlies only to those\\nwho request them, letting others read these at our site.  In this report, we again enclose a card that can be\\nreturned by those wanting to get printed quarterlies in 1999.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I have two simple goals in reporting: 1) We want to give you the information that we would\\nwish you to give us if our positions were reversed; and 2) We want to make Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information accessible\\nto all of you simultaneously.  Our ability to reach that second goal is greatly helped by the Internet.\\n</p>\\n<p>In another portion of his September speech, Arthur Levitt deplored what he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cselective disclosure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHis remarks were timely:  Today, many companies matter-of-factly favor Wall Street analysts and institutional</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The rest of Berkshire\\'s giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick\\nto the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves\\ntake on the responsibility for their personal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $12.5\\nmillion in 1998, including in-kind donations of $2.0 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual\\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.

To be safe, we have booked both Aksarben Coliseum, which holds\\nabout 14,000 and the Holiday Convention Centre, which can seat an additional 5,000.  Because we know that our\\nOmaha shareholders will want to be good hosts to the out-of-towners (many of them come from outside the U.S),\\nwe plan to give those visitors first crack at the Aksarben tickets and to subsequently allocate these to greater\\nOmaha residents on a first-come, first-served basis.  If we exhaust the Aksarben tickets, we will begin distributing\\nHoliday tickets to Omaha shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>If we end up using both locations, Charlie and I will split our pre-meeting time between the two.\\nAdditionally, we will have exhibits and also the Berkshire movie, large television screens and microphones at both\\nsites.  When we break for lunch, many attendees will leave Aksarben, which means that those at Holiday can,\\nif they wish, make the five-minute trip to Aksarben and finish out the day there.

Over the last 35 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share\\nbook value has grown from $19 to $37,987, a rate of 24.0% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>The numbers on the facing page show just how poor our 1999 record was.  We had the worst absolute\\nperformance of my tenure and, compared to the S&amp;P, the worst relative performance as well.  Relative results are what\\nconcern us: Over time, bad relative numbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even Inspector Clouseau could find last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilty party: your Chairman.

What most hurt us during\\nthe year was the inferior performance of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equity portfolio \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving\\naside the small piece of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine.  Several of our largest investees badly\\nlagged the market in 1999 because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had disappointing operating results.  We still like these businesses and are\\ncontent to have major investments in them.  But their stumbles damaged our performance last year, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no sure\\nthing that they will quickly regain their stride.\\n</p>\\n<p>The fallout from our weak results in 1999 was a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price.  In  1998,\\nto go back a bit, the stock outperformed the business.  Last year the business did much better than the stock, a\\ndivergence that has continued to the date of this letter.  Over time, of course, the performance of the stock must roughly\\nmatch the performance of the business.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite our poor showing last year, Charlie Munger, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect\\nthat the gain in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value over the next decade will modestly exceed the gain from owning  the S&amp;P.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee that, of course.  But we are willing to back our conviction with our own money.  To repeat a fact\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard before, well over 99% of my net worth resides in Berkshire.  Neither my wife nor I have ever sold a share\\nof Berkshire and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 unless our checks stop clearing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have no intention of doing so.\\n</p>\\n<p>Please note that I spoke of hoping to beat the S&amp;P \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodestly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  For Berkshire, truly large superiorities over\\nthat index are a thing of the past.  They existed then because we could buy both businesses and stocks at far more\\nattractive prices than we can now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital base, a situation that allowed\\nus to consider a much wider range of investment opportunities than are available to us today.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our optimism about Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance is also tempered by the expectation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 indeed, in our minds,\\nthe virtual certainty \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that the S&amp;P will do far less well in the next decade or two than it has done since 1982.  A\\nrecent article in Fortune expressed my views as to why this is inevitable, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m enclosing a copy with this report.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our goal is to run our present businesses well \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a task made easy  because of the outstanding managers we\\nhave in place \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and to acquire additional businesses having economic characteristics and managers comparable to\\nthose we already own.  We made important progress in this respect during 1999 by acquiring Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Furniture and\\ncontracting to buy a major portion of MidAmerican Energy.  We will talk more about these companies later in the\\nreport but let me emphasize one point here: We bought both for cash, issuing no Berkshire shares.

They work\\nneither because they need the money nor because they are contractually obligated to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have no contracts at Berkshire.\\nRather, they work long and hard because they love their businesses.  And I use the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctheir\\xe2\\x80\\x9d advisedly, since these\\nmanagers are truly in charge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there are no show-and-tell presentations in Omaha, no budgets to be approved by\\nheadquarters, no dictums issued about capital expenditures.  We simply ask our managers to run their companies as if\\nthese are the sole asset of their families and will remain so for the next century.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I try to behave with our managers just as we attempt to behave with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shareholders, treating\\nboth groups as we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.  Though \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means nothing to me\\nfinancially, I love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me a sense of achievement, a freedom to act as\\nI see fit and an opportunity to interact daily with people I like and trust.  Why should our managers \\xe2\\x80\\x94  accomplished\\nartists at what they do \\xe2\\x80\\x94 see things differently?\\n</p>\\n<p>In their relations with Berkshire, our managers often appear to be hewing to President Kennedy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charge, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk\\nnot what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a remarkable story from last year:\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about R. C. Willey, Utah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominant home furnishing business, which Berkshire purchased from Bill Child and his\\nfamily in 1995.  Bill and most of his managers are Mormons, and for this reason R. C. Willey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stores have never\\noperated on Sunday.  This is a difficult way to do business:  Sunday is the favorite shopping day for many customers.\\nBill, nonetheless, stuck to his principles -- and while doing so built his business from $250,000 of annual sales in 1954,\\nwhen he took over, to $342 million in 1999.\\n</p>\\n<p>Bill felt that R. C. Willey could operate successfully in markets outside of Utah and in 1997 suggested that we open\\na store in Boise.  I was highly skeptical about taking a no-Sunday policy into a new territory where we would be up\\nagainst entrenched rivals open seven days a week.  Nevertheless, this was Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business to run.  So,  despite my\\nreservations, I told him to follow both his business judgment and his religious convictions.\\n</p>\\n<p>Bill then insisted on a truly extraordinary proposition: He would personally buy the land and build the store \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for\\nabout $9 million as it turned out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and would sell it to us at his cost if it proved to be successful.  On the other hand,\\nif sales fell short of his expectations, we could exit the business without paying Bill a cent. This outcome, of course, would\\nleave him with a huge investment in an empty building.  I told him that I appreciated his offer but felt that if Berkshire\\nwas going to get the upside it should also take the downside.  Bill said nothing doing: If there was to be failure because\\nof his religious beliefs, he wanted to take the blow personally.\\n</p>\\n<p>The store opened last August and immediately became a huge success.  Bill thereupon turned the property over\\nto us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including some extra land that had appreciated significantly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and we wrote him a check for his cost.

Then, as the speech progressed, my memory miraculously began to improve.  By the end of my talk, it\\nall had come back to me: Opening a store in Boise had been my idea.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Our main business \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though we have others of great importance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is insurance.  To understand Berkshire,\\ntherefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the\\namount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these\\nfactors.\\n</p>\\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are\\nreceived before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests\\nthe money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually\\ndo not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an \"underwriting loss,\" which is the\\ncost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would\\notherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\\n</p>\\n<p>A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring\\ntheir underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company\\'s true cost of float.  Errors\\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly\\ninto earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can\\ntypically do no more than accept what\\'s presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name\\nauditors have implicitly blessed.  In 1999 a number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery of\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that investors had relied on earlier when making their buy and sell decisions.  At Berkshire, we strive to\\nbe conservative and consistent in our reserving.  Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant surprise is always possible.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance\\noperations since we entered the business 33 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional\\nlines are included in the segment \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOther Primary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  For the table we have calculated our float \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we generate in\\nlarge amounts relative to our premium volume \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under\\nreinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs,\\nprepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.

Over the years we have usually recorded only a small\\nunderwriting loss \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which means our cost of float was correspondingly low \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or actually had an underwriting profit,</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an\\nunderwriting profit.  In 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting loss that left us with float cost of 5.8%.\\nOne mildly mitigating factor: We enthusiastically welcomed $400 million of the loss because it stems from business that\\nwill deliver us exceptional float over the next decade.  The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly unwelcome, and\\nour overall result must be judged extremely poor.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000, but\\nany decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO, which we will discuss later.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are a number of people who deserve credit for manufacturing so much \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno-cost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d float over the years.\\nForemost is Ajit Jain.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simply impossible to overstate Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built an\\noutstanding reinsurance business, which during his tenure has earned an underwriting profit and now holds $6.3 billion\\nof float.\\n</p>\\n<p>In Ajit, we have an underwriter equipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the realism to forget\\nabout those he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t evaluate; the courage to write huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline to\\nreject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate.  It is rare to find a person possessing any one of these\\ntalents.  For one person to have them all is remarkable.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since Ajit specializes in super-cat reinsurance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely large when they\\noccur, his business is sure to be far more volatile than most insurance operations.  To date, we have benefitted from good\\nluck on this volatile book.  Even so, Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievements are truly extraordinary.\\n</p>\\n<p>In a smaller but nevertheless important way, our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother primary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d insurance operation has also added to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nintrinsic value.  This collection of insurers has delivered a $192 million underwriting profit over the past five years while\\nsupplying us with the float shown in the table.  In the insurance world, results like this are uncommon, and for their feat\\nwe thank Rod Eldred, Brad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster.\\n</p>\\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the General Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year in 1999 (though\\ninvestment income left the company well in the black).  Our business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and\\ninternationally, a condition that is improving but not yet corrected.  Over time, however, the company should develop\\na growing amount of low-cost float.  At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive compensation plans are\\nnow directly tied to the variables of float growth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value for owners.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even though a reinsurer may have a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot count on every\\nyear coming up roses.  Reinsurance is a highly volatile business, and neither General Re nor Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operation is immune\\nto bad pricing behavior in the industry.  But General Re has the distribution , the underwriting skills, the culture, and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s backing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the financial clout to become the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most profitable reinsurance company.  Getting\\nthere will take time, energy and discipline, but we have no doubt that Ron Ferguson and his crew can make it happen.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com)\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO made exceptional progress in 1999.  The reasons are simple: We have a terrific business idea being\\nimplemented by an extraordinary manager, Tony Nicely.  When Berkshire purchased GEICO at the beginning of 1996,\\nwe handed the keys to Tony and asked him to run the operation exactly as if he owned 100% of it.

       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>8\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1995, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors.  Last year the company spent\\n$242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631.  And we are just starting: The pace will step up materially in 2000.\\nIndeed, we would happily commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew we could handle the business smoothly\\nand if we expected the last dollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Currently two trends are affecting acquisition costs.  The bad news is that it has become more expensive to develop\\ninquiries.  Media rates have risen, and we are also seeing diminishing returns \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, as both we and our competitors\\nstep up advertising, inquiries per ad fall for all of us.  These negatives are partly offset, however, by the fact that our\\nclosure ratio \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the percentage of inquiries converted to sales \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has steadily improved.  Overall, we believe that our\\ncost of new business, though definitely rising, is well below that of the industry.  Of even greater importance, our\\noperating costs for renewal business are the lowest among broad-based national auto insurers.  Both of these major\\ncompetitive advantages are sustainable.  Others may copy our model, but they will be unable to replicate our economics.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table above makes it appear that GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retention of policyholders is falling, but for two reasons\\nappearances are in this case deceiving.  First, in the last few years our business mix has moved away from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpreferred\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\npolicyholders, for whom industrywide retention rates are high, toward \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-standard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policyholders for\\nwhom retention rates are much lower.  (Despite the nomenclature, the three classes have similar profit prospects.)\\nSecond, retention rates for relatively new policyholders are always lower than those for long-time customers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and\\nbecause of our accelerated growth, our policyholder ranks now include an increased proportion of new customers.\\nAdjusted for these two factors, our retention rate has changed hardly at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>We told you last year that underwriting margins for both GEICO and the industry would fall in 1999, and they\\ndid.  We make a similar prediction for 2000.  A few years ago margins got too wide, having enjoyed the effects of an\\nunusual and unexpected decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents.  The industry responded by reducing rates\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but now is having to contend with an increase in loss costs.  We would not be surprised to see the margins of auto\\ninsurers deteriorate by around three percentage points in 2000.\\n</p>\\n<p>Two negatives besides worsening frequency and severity will hurt the industry this year.  First, rate increases go\\ninto effect only slowly, both because of regulatory delay and because insurance contracts must run their course before\\nnew rates can be put in.  Second, reported earnings of many auto insurers have benefitted in the last few years from\\nreserve releases, made possible because the companies overestimated their loss costs in still-earlier years.  This reservoir\\nof redundant reserves has now largely dried up, and future boosts to earnings from this source will be minor at best. \\n</p>\\n<p>In compensating its associates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from Tony on down \\xe2\\x80\\x94 GEICO continues to use two variables, and only two,\\nin determining what bonuses and profit-sharing contributions will be: 1) its percentage growth in policyholders and 2)\\nthe earnings of its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseasoned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d business, meaning policies that have been with us for more than a year.  We did\\noutstandingly well on both fronts during 1999 and therefore made a profit-sharing payment of 28.4% of salary (in total,\\n$113.3 million) to the great majority of our associates.  Tony and I love writing those checks.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, we want to have compensation policies that are both easy to understand and in sync with what we\\nwish our associates to accomplish.  Writing new business is expensive (and, as mentioned, getting more expensive).\\nIf we were to include those costs in our calculation of bonuses \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as managements did before our arrival at GEICO \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwe would be penalizing our associates for garnering new policies, even though these are very much in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninterest.  So, in effect, we say to our associates that we will foot the bill for new business.  Indeed, because percentage\\ngrowth in policyholders is part of our compensation scheme, we reward our associates for producing this initially-\\nunprofitable business.  And then we  reward them additionally for holding down costs on our seasoned business.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite the extensive advertising we do, our best source of new business is word-of-mouth recommendations from\\nexisting policyholders, who on the whole are pleased with our prices and service.  An article published last year by\\nKiplinger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Personal Finance Magazine gives a good picture of where we stand in customer satisfaction: The\\nmagazine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey of 20 state insurance departments showed that GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint ratio was well below the ratio\\nfor most of its major competitors.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our strong referral business means that we probably could maintain our policy count by spending as little as $50\\nmillion annually on advertising.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a guess, of course, and we will never know whether it is accurate because\\nTony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foot is going to stay on the advertising pedal (and my foot will be on his).  Nevertheless, I want to emphasize\\nthat a major percentage of the $300-$350 million we will spend in 2000 on advertising, as well as large additional costs</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

FSI trains pilots (as well as other\\ntransportation professionals) and is five times or so the size of its nearest competitor.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another common characteristic of the companies is that they are still managed by their founding entrepreneurs.\\nAl Ueltschi started FSI in 1951 with $10,000, and Rich Santulli invented the fractional-ownership industry in 1986.\\nThese men are both remarkable managers who have no financial need to work but thrive on helping their companies\\ngrow and excel.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though these two businesses have leadership positions that are similar, they differ in their economic\\ncharacteristics.  FSI must lay out huge amounts of capital.  A single flight simulator can cost as much as $15 million\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and we have 222.  Only one person at a time, furthermore, can be trained in a simulator, which means that the capital\\ninvestment per dollar of revenue at FSI is exceptionally high.  Operating margins must therefore also be high, if we are\\nto earn a reasonable return on capital.  Last year we made capital expenditures of $215 million at FSI and FlightSafety\\nBoeing, its 50%-owned affiliate.\\n</p>\\n<p>At EJA, in contrast, the customer owns the equipment, though we, of course, must invest in a core fleet of our own\\nplanes to ensure outstanding service.  For example, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, EJA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s busiest day of the year, strains\\nour resources since fractions of 169 planes are owned by 1,412 customers, many of whom are bent on flying home\\nbetween 3 and 6 p.m.  On that day, and certain others, we need a supply of company-owned aircraft to make sure all\\nparties get where they want, when they want.\\n</p>\\n<p>Still, most of the planes we fly are owned by customers, which means that modest pre-tax margins in this business\\ncan produce good returns on equity.  Currently, our customers own planes worth over $2 billion, and in addition we have\\n$4.2 billion of planes on order.  Indeed, the limiting factor in our business right now is the availability of planes.  We</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>10\\n</p>\\n<p>now are taking delivery of about 8% of all business jets manufactured in the world, and we wish we could get a bigger\\nshare than that.  Though EJA was supply-constrained in 1999, its recurring revenues \\xe2\\x80\\x94 monthly management fees plus\\nhourly flight fees \\xe2\\x80\\x94 increased 46%.\\n</p>\\n<p>The fractional-ownership industry is still in its infancy.  EJA is now building critical mass in Europe, and over\\ntime we will expand around the world.  Doing that will be expensive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 very expensive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but we will spend what it\\ntakes.  Scale is vital to both us and our customers: The company with the most planes in the air worldwide will be able\\nto offer its customers the best service.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy a fraction, get a fleet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has real meaning at EJA.\\n</p>\\n<p>EJA enjoys another important advantage in that its two largest competitors are both subsidiaries of aircraft\\nmanufacturers and sell only the aircraft their parents make.  Though these are fine planes, these competitors are severely\\nlimited in the cabin styles and mission capabilities they can offer.  EJA, in contrast, offers a wide array of planes from\\nfive suppliers.  Consequently, we can give the customer whatever he needs to buy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rather than his getting what the\\ncompetitor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parent needs to sell.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year in this report, I described my family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delight with the one-quarter (200 flight hours annually) of a\\nHawker 1000 that we had owned since 1995.  I got so pumped up by my own prose that shortly thereafter I signed up\\nfor one-sixteenth of a Cessna V Ultra as well.  Now my annual outlays at EJA and Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, combined, total ten times\\nmy salary.  Think of this as a rough guideline for your own expenditures with us. \\n</p>\\n<p>During the past year, two of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outside directors have also signed on with EJA.  (Maybe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paying\\nthem too much.)  You should be aware that they and I are charged exactly the same price for planes and service as is\\nany other customer: EJA follows a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmost favored nations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policy, with no one getting a special deal.\\n</p>\\n<p>And now, brace yourself.  Last year, EJA passed the ultimate test: Charlie signed up.  No other endorsement could\\nspeak more eloquently to the value of the EJA service.  Give us a call at 1-800-848-6436 and ask for our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite paper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\non fractional ownership.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisitions of 1999\\n</p>\\n<p>At both GEICO and Executive Jet, our best source of new customers is the happy ones we already have.  Indeed,\\nabout 65% of our new owners of aircraft come as referrals from current owners who have fallen in love with the service.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our acquisitions usually develop in the same way.  At other companies, executives may devote themselves to\\npursuing acquisition possibilities with investment bankers, utilizing an auction process that has become standardized.\\nIn this exercise the bankers prepare a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that makes me think of the Superman comics of my youth.  In the Wall\\nStreet version, a formerly mild-mannered company emerges from the investment banker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phone booth able to leap over\\ncompetitors in a single bound and with earnings moving faster than a speeding bullet.  Titillated by the book\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndescription of the acquiree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s powers, acquisition-hungry CEOs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Lois Lanes all, beneath their cool exteriors \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\npromptly swoon.\\n</p>\\n<p>What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s particularly entertaining in these books is the precision with which earnings are projected for many years\\nahead.  If you ask the author-banker, however, what his own firm will earn next month, he will go into a protective\\ncrouch and tell you that business and markets are far too uncertain for him to venture a forecast.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one story I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resist relating: In 1985, a major investment banking house undertook to sell Scott Fetzer,\\noffering it widely \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but with no success.  Upon reading of this strikeout, I wrote Ralph Schey, then and now Scott\\nFetzer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, expressing an interest in buying the business.  I had never met Ralph, but within a week we had a deal.\\nUnfortunately, Scott Fetzer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter of engagement with the banking firm provided it a $2.5 million fee upon sale, even\\nif it had nothing to do with finding the buyer.  I guess the lead banker felt he should do something for his payment, so\\nhe graciously offered us a copy of the book on Scott Fetzer that his firm had prepared.  With his customary tact, Charlie\\nresponded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pay $2.5 million not to read it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, our carefully-crafted acquisition strategy is simply to wait for the phone to ring.  Happily, it\\nsometimes does so, usually because a manager who sold to us earlier has recommended to a friend that he think about\\nfollowing suit.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>11\\n</p>\\n<p>Which brings us to the furniture business.  Two years ago I recounted how the acquisition of Nebraska Furniture\\nMart in 1983 and my subsequent association with the Blumkin family led to follow-on transactions with R. C. Willey\\n(1995) and Star Furniture (1997).  For me, these relationships have all been terrific.  Not only did Berkshire acquire\\nthree outstanding retailers; these deals also allowed me to become friends with some of the finest people you will ever\\nmeet.\\n</p>\\n<p>Naturally, I have persistently asked the Blumkins, Bill Child and Melvyn Wolff whether there are any more out\\nthere like you.  Their invariable answer was the Tatelman brothers of New England and their remarkable furniture\\nbusiness, Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\n</p>\\n<p>I met Barry and Eliot Tatelman last year and we soon signed an agreement for Berkshire to acquire the company.\\nLike our three previous furniture acquisitions, this business had long been in the family \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in this case since 1927, when\\nBarry and Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandfather began operations in a Boston suburb.  Under the brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 management, Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has\\ngrown ever more dominant in its region, becoming the largest furniture retailer in New Hampshire as well as\\nMassachusetts.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Tatelmans don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just sell furniture or manage stores.  They also present customers with a dazzling\\nentertainment experience called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshoppertainment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  A family visiting a store can have a terrific time, while\\nconcurrently viewing an extraordinary selection of merchandise.  The business results are also extraordinary: Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nhas the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture operation in the country.  I urge you to visit one of their\\nstores if you are in the Boston area \\xe2\\x80\\x94 particularly the one at Natick, which is Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newest.  Bring money.\\n</p>\\n<p>Barry and Eliot are classy people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just like their counterparts at Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three other furniture operations.\\nWhen they sold to us, they elected to give each of their employees at least 50\\xc2\\xa2 for every hour that he or she had worked\\nfor Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  This payment added up to $9 million, which came from the Tatelmans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own pockets, not from Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\nAnd Barry and Eliot were thrilled to write the checks.\\n</p>\\n<p>Each of our furniture operations is number one in its territory.  We now sell more furniture than anyone else in\\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Texas, Nebraska, Utah and Idaho.  Last year Star\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Melvyn Wolff and his sister, Shirley\\nToomim, scored two major successes: a move into San Antonio and a significant enlargement of Star\\xe2\\x80\\x99s store in Austin.\\n</p>\\n<p>There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no operation in the furniture retailing business remotely like the one assembled by Berkshire.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fun for\\nme and profitable for you.  W. C. Fields once said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a woman who drove me to drink, but unfortunately I never\\nhad the chance to thank her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to make that mistake.  My thanks go to Louie, Ron and Irv Blumkin for\\ngetting me started in the furniture business and for unerringly guiding me as we have assembled the group we now have.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, for our second acquisition deal: It came to us through my good friend, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman of Level\\n3 Communications and a director of Berkshire.  Walter has many other business connections as well, and one of them\\nis with MidAmerican Energy, a utility company in which he has substantial holdings and on whose board he sits.  At\\na conference in California that we both attended last September, Walter casually asked me whether Berkshire might be\\ninterested in making a large investment in MidAmerican, and from the start the idea of being in partnership with Walter\\nstruck me as a good one.  Upon returning to Omaha, I read some of MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public reports and had two short\\nmeetings with Walter and David Sokol, MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talented and entrepreneurial CEO.  I then said that, at an\\nappropriate price, we would indeed like to make a deal.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisitions in the electric utility industry are complicated by a variety of regulations including the Public Utility\\nHolding Company Act of 1935.  Therefore, we had to structure a transaction that would avoid Berkshire gaining voting\\ncontrol.  Instead we are purchasing an 11% fixed-income security, along with a combination of common stock and\\nexchangeable preferred that will give Berkshire just under 10% of the voting power of MidAmerican but about 76% of\\nthe equity interest.  All told, our investment will be about $2 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Walter characteristically backed up his convictions with real money: He and his family will buy more\\nMidAmerican stock for cash when the transaction closes, bringing their total investment to about $280 million.  Walter\\nwill also be the controlling shareholder of the company, and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of a better person to hold that post.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though there are many regulatory constraints in the utility industry, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that we will make additional\\ncommitments in the field.  If we do, the amounts involved could be large.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '10': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>12\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisition Accounting\\n</p>\\n<p>Once again, I would like to make some comments about accounting, in this case about its application to\\nacquisitions.  This is currently a very contentious topic and, before the dust settles, Congress may even intervene (a truly\\nterrible idea).\\n</p>\\n<p>When a company is acquired, generally accepted accounting principles (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGAAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) currently condone two very\\ndifferent ways of recording the transaction: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurchase\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpooling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  In a pooling, stock must be the currency; in a\\npurchase, payment can be made in either cash or stock.  Whatever the currency, managements usually detest purchase\\naccounting because it almost always requires that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d account be established and subsequently written off \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\na process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge that normally persists for decades.  In contrast, pooling avoids\\na goodwill account, which is why managements love it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFASB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) has proposed an end to pooling, and many CEOs are\\ngirding for battle.  It will be an important fight, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll venture some opinions.  To begin with, we agree with the many\\nmanagers who argue that goodwill amortization charges are usually spurious.  You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find my thinking about this in the\\nappendix to our 1983 annual report, which is available on our website, and in the Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual on pages 55 - 62.\\n</p>\\n<p>For accounting rules to mandate amortization that will, in the usual case, conflict with reality is deeply\\ntroublesome:  Most accounting charges relate to what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on, even if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t precisely measure it.  As an\\nexample, depreciation charges can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t with precision calibrate the decline in value that physical assets suffer, but these\\ncharges do at least describe something that is truly occurring: Physical assets invariably deteriorate.  Correspondingly,\\nobsolescence charges for  inventories, bad debt charges for receivables and accruals for warranties are among the charges\\nthat reflect true costs.  The annual charges for these expenses can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be exactly measured, but the necessity for estimating\\nthem is obvious.\\n</p>\\n<p>In contrast, economic goodwill does not, in many cases, diminish.  Indeed, in a great many instances \\xe2\\x80\\x94  perhaps\\nmost \\xe2\\x80\\x94  it actually grows in value over time.  In character, economic goodwill is much like land: The value of both\\nassets is sure to fluctuate, but the direction in which value is going to go is in no way ordained.  At See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, for example,\\neconomic goodwill has grown, in an irregular but very substantial manner, for 78 years.  And, if we run the business\\nright, growth of that kind will probably continue for at least another 78 years. \\n</p>\\n<p>To escape from the fiction of goodwill charges, managers embrace the fiction of pooling.  This accounting\\nconvention is grounded in the poetic notion that when two rivers merge their streams become indistinguishable.  Under\\nthis concept, a company that has been merged into a larger enterprise has not been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurchased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (even though it will\\noften have received a large \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell-out\\xe2\\x80\\x9d premium).  Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those pesky subsequent\\ncharges to earnings are eliminated.  Instead, the accounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses had\\nforever been one unit.\\n</p>\\n<p>So much for poetry.  The reality of merging is usually far different: There is indisputably an acquirer and an\\nacquiree, and the latter has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurchased,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d no matter how the deal has been structured.  If you think otherwise, just\\nask employees severed from their jobs which company was the conqueror and which was the conquered.  You will find\\nno confusion.  So on this point the FASB is correct: In most mergers, a purchase has been made.  Yes, there are some\\ntrue \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmergers of equals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but they are few and far between.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reality-based approach that should both satisfy the FASB, which correctly wishes\\nto record a purchase, and meet the objections of managements to nonsensical charges for diminution of goodwill.  We\\nwould first have the acquiring company record its purchase price \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether paid in stock or cash \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at fair value.  In\\nmost cases, this procedure would create a large asset representing economic goodwill.  We would then leave this asset\\non the books, not requiring its amortization.  Later, if the economic goodwill became impaired, as it sometimes would,\\nit would be written down just as would any other asset judged to be impaired.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our proposed rule were to be adopted, it should be applied retroactively so that acquisition accounting would\\nbe consistent throughout America \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a far cry from what exists today.  One prediction: If this plan were to take effect,\\nmanagements would structure acquisitions more sensibly, deciding whether to use cash or stock based on the real\\nconsequences for their shareholders rather than on the unreal consequences for their reported earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>13\\n</p>\\n<p>In our purchase of Jordan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, we followed a procedure that will maximize the cash produced for our shareholders\\nbut minimize the earnings we report to you.  Berkshire purchased assets for cash, an approach that on our tax returns\\npermits us to amortize the resulting goodwill over a 15-year period.  Obviously, this tax deduction  materially increases\\nthe amount of cash delivered by the business.  In contrast, when stock, rather than assets, is purchased for cash, the\\nresulting writeoffs of goodwill are not tax-deductible.  The economic difference between these two approaches is\\nsubstantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>From the economic standpoint of the acquiring company, the worst deal of all is a stock-for-stock acquisition.\\nHere, a huge price is often paid without there being any step-up in the tax basis of either the stock of the acquiree or its\\nassets.  If the acquired entity is subsequently sold, its owner may owe a large capital gains tax (at a 35% or greater rate),\\neven though the sale may truly be producing a major economic loss.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have made some deals at Berkshire that used far-from-optimal tax structures.  These deals occurred because\\nthe sellers insisted on a given structure and because, overall, we still felt the acquisition made sense.

For the reasons discussed on page 61, this form of presentation seems to us to be more useful\\nto investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-\\npremiums to be charged off business-by-business.

       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>14\\n</p>\\n<p>Almost all of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses had excellent results in 1999.  The exception\\nwas Dexter Shoe, and there the shortfall did not occur because of managerial problems: In skills, energy and devotion\\nto their work, the Dexter executives are every bit the equal of our other managers.  But we manufacture shoes primarily\\nin the U.S., and it has become extremely difficult for domestic producers to compete effectively.  In 1999, approximately\\n93% of the 1.3 billion pairs of shoes purchased in this country came from abroad, where extremely low-cost labor is the\\nrule.\\n</p>\\n<p>Counting both Dexter and H. H. Brown, we are currently the leading domestic manufacturer of shoes, and we are\\nlikely to continue to be.  We have loyal, highly-skilled workers in our U.S. plants, and we want to retain every job here\\nthat we can.  Nevertheless, in order to remain viable, we are sourcing more of our output internationally.  In doing that,\\nwe have incurred significant severance and relocation costs that are included in the earnings we show in the table.\\n</p>\\n<p>A few years back, Helzberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, our 200-store jewelry operation, needed to make operating adjustments to restore\\nmargins to appropriate levels.  Under Jeff Comment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, the job was done and profits have dramatically\\nrebounded.  In the shoe business, where we have Harold Alfond, Peter Lunder, Frank Rooney and Jim Issler in charge,\\nI believe we will see a similar improvement over the next few years.\\n</p>\\n<p>See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candies deserves a special comment, given that it achieved a record operating margin of 24% last year.\\nSince we bought See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for $25 million in 1972, it has earned $857 million pre-tax.  And, despite its growth, the business\\nhas required very little additional capital.  Give the credit for this performance to Chuck Huggins.  Charlie and I put\\nhim in charge the day of our purchase, and his fanatical insistence on both product quality and friendly service has\\nrewarded customers, employees and owners.\\n</p>\\n<p>Chuck gets better every year.  When he took charge of See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at age 46, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-tax profit, expressed\\nin millions, was about 10% of his age.  Today he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 74, and the ratio has increased to 100%.

In addition, on pages 63 - 69, we have rearranged Berkshire\\'s financial\\ndata into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the\\ncompany.\\n</p>\\n<p>Look-Through Earnings\\n</p>\\n<p>Reported earnings are an inadequate measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers\\nshown in the table presented earlier include only the dividends we receive from investees \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though these dividends\\ntypically represent only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership.  Not that we mind this division\\nof money, since on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees as more valuable to us than the portion\\npaid out.  The reason for our thinking is simple:  Our investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high\\nrates of return.  So why should we want them paid out?\\n</p>\\n<p>To depict something closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept\\nof \"look-through\" earnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\\nsection, plus; (2) our share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not\\nreflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of\\ninvestees had instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating \"operating earnings\" here, we exclude purchase-\\naccounting adjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\\n</p>\\n<p>The following table sets forth our 1999 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can be no more\\nthan approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.  (The dividends paid to us by these investees have\\nbeen included in the operating earnings itemized on page 13, mostly under \"Insurance Group:  Net Investment Income.\")</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

As I mentioned earlier, several of the companies in which we have large\\ninvestments had disappointing business results last year.  Nevertheless, we believe these companies have important\\ncompetitive advantages that will endure over time.  This attribute, which makes for good long-term investment results,\\nis one Charlie and I occasionally believe we can identify.  More often, however, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not at least with a high\\ndegree of conviction.  This explains, by the way, why we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t own stocks of tech companies, even though we share the\\ngeneral view that our society will be transformed by their products and services.  Our problem \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t solve\\nby studying up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech field possess a truly durable competitive\\nadvantage.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our lack of tech insights, we should add, does not distress us.  After all, there are a great many business areas in\\nwhich Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation expertise.  For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it\\ncomes to evaluating patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects.  So we simply don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get into judgments\\nin those fields.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>16\\n</p>\\n<p>If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence and when\\nwe are approaching the perimeter.  Predicting the long-term economics of companies that operate in fast-changing\\nindustries is simply far beyond our perimeter.  If others claim predictive skill in those industries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and seem to have\\ntheir claims validated by the behavior of the stock market \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we neither envy nor emulate them.  Instead, we just stick\\nwith what we understand.  If we stray, we will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless and substituted\\nhope for rationality.  Fortunately, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost certain there will be opportunities from time to time for Berkshire to do\\nwell within the circle we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve staked out.\\n</p>\\n<p>Right now, the prices of the fine businesses we already own are just not that attractive.  In other words, we feel\\nmuch better about the businesses than their stocks.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t added to our present holdings.  Nevertheless,\\nwe haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet scaled back our portfolio in a major way:  If the choice is between a questionable business at a\\ncomfortable price or a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer the latter.  What really gets our\\nattention, however, is a comfortable business at a comfortable price.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our reservations about the prices of securities we own apply also to the general level of equity prices.  We have\\nnever attempted to forecast what the stock market is going to do in the next month or the next year, and we are not\\ntrying to do that now.  But, as I point out in the enclosed article, equity investors currently seem wildly optimistic in\\ntheir expectations about future returns.\\n</p>\\n<p>We see the growth in corporate profits as being largely tied to the business done in the country (GDP), and we see\\nGDP growing at a real rate of about 3%.  In addition, we have hypothesized 2% inflation.  Charlie and I have no\\nparticular conviction about the accuracy of 2%.  However, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view:  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\\n(TIPS) yield about two percentage points less than the standard treasury bond, and if you believe inflation rates are going\\nto be higher than that, you can profit by simply buying TIPS and shorting Governments.\\n</p>\\n<p>If profits do indeed grow along with GDP, at about a 5% rate, the valuation placed on American business is\\nunlikely to climb by much more than that.  Add in something for dividends, and you emerge with returns from equities\\nthat are dramatically less than most investors have either experienced in the past or expect in the future.  If investor\\nexpectations become more realistic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they almost certainly will \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the market adjustment is apt to be severe,\\nparticularly in sectors in which speculation has been concentrated.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire will someday have opportunities to deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we are confident\\nof that.  But, as the song goes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho knows where or when?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Meanwhile, if anyone starts explaining to you what is\\ngoing on in the truly-manic portions of this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenchanted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d market, you might remember still another line of song: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFools\\ngive you reasons, wise men never try.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Share Repurchases\\n</p>\\n<p>Recently, a number of shareholders have suggested to us that Berkshire repurchase its shares.  Usually the requests\\nwere rationally based, but a few leaned on spurious logic.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: First, the\\ncompany has available funds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cash plus sensible borrowing capacity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 beyond the near-term needs of the business\\nand, second, finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, conservatively-calculated.  To this we add\\na caveat: Shareholders should have been supplied all the information they need for estimating that value.  Otherwise,\\ninsiders could take advantage of their uninformed partners and buy out their interests at a fraction of true worth.  We\\nhave, on rare occasions, seen that happen.  Usually, of course, chicanery is employed to drive stock prices up, not down.\\n</p>\\n<p>The business \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneeds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that I speak of are of two kinds: First, expenditures that a company must make to maintain\\nits competitive position (e.g., the remodeling of stores at Helzberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) and, second, optional outlays, aimed at business\\ngrowth, that management expects will produce more than a dollar of value for each dollar spent (R. C. Willey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nexpansion into Idaho).\\n</p>\\n<p>When available funds exceed needs of those kinds, a company with a growth-oriented shareholder population can\\nbuy new businesses or repurchase shares.  If a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock is selling well below intrinsic value, repurchases usually\\nmake the most sense.  In the mid-1970s, the wisdom of making these was virtually screaming at managements, but few\\nresponded.  In most cases, those that did made their owners much wealthier than if alternative courses of action had been</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>17\\n</p>\\n<p>pursued.  Indeed, during the 1970s (and, spasmodically, for some years thereafter) we searched for companies that were\\nlarge repurchasers of their shares.  This often was a tipoff that the company was both undervalued and run by a\\nshareholder-oriented management.\\n</p>\\n<p>That day is past.  Now, repurchases are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, in our view,\\nignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price.  The shareholder who chooses to sell today, of course, is benefitted\\nby any buyer, whatever his origin or motives.  But the continuing shareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic\\nvalue.  Buying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick around.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I admit that we feel confident in estimating intrinsic value for only a portion of traded equities and\\nthen only when we employ a range of values, rather than some pseudo-precise figure.  Nevertheless, it appears to us that\\nmany companies now making repurchases are overpaying departing shareholders at the expense of those who stay.  In\\ndefense of those companies, I would say that it is natural for CEOs to be optimistic about their own businesses.  They\\nalso know a whole lot more about them than I do.  However, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but feel that too often today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repurchases are\\ndictated by management\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshow confidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-share\\nvalue.\\n</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, too, companies say they are repurchasing shares to offset the shares issued when stock options granted\\nat much lower prices are exercised.  This \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuy high, sell low\\xe2\\x80\\x9d strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but never intentionally!  Managements, however, seem to follow this perverse activity very cheerfully.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, both option grants and repurchases may make sense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the case, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because the two\\nactivities are logically related.  Rationally, a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to repurchase shares or to issue them should stand on\\nits own feet.  Just because stock has been issued to satisfy options \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or for any other reason \\xe2\\x80\\x94 does not mean that stock\\nshould be repurchased at a price above intrinsic value.  Correspondingly, a stock that sells well below intrinsic value\\nshould be repurchased whether or not stock has previously been issued (or may be because of outstanding options).\\n</p>\\n<p>You should be aware that, at certain times in the past, I have erred in not making repurchases.  My appraisal of\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value was then too conservative or I was too enthused about some alternative use of funds.  We have\\ntherefore missed some opportunities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trading volume at these points was too light for us to have\\ndone much buying, which means that the gain in our per-share value would have been minimal.  (A repurchase of, say,\\n2% of a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares at a 25% discount from per-share intrinsic value produces only a \\xc2\\xbd% gain in that value at\\nmost \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and even less if the funds could alternatively have been deployed in value-building moves.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Some of the letters we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received clearly imply that the writer is unconcerned about intrinsic value considerations\\nbut instead wants us to trumpet an intention to repurchase so that the stock will rise (or quit going down).  If the writer\\nwants to sell tomorrow, his thinking makes sense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for him! \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but if he intends to hold, he should instead hope the\\nstock falls and trades in enough volume for us to buy a lot of it.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only way a repurchase program can have\\nany real benefit for a continuing shareholder.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will not repurchase shares unless we believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value,\\nconservatively calculated.  Nor will we attempt to talk the stock up or down.  (Neither publicly or privately have I ever\\ntold anyone to buy or sell Berkshire shares.)  Instead we will give all shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and potential shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the\\nsame valuation-related information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed.\\n</p>\\n<p>Recently, when the A shares fell below $45,000, we considered making repurchases.  We decided, however, to\\ndelay buying, if indeed we elect to do any, until shareholders have had the chance to review this report.  If we do find\\nthat repurchases make sense, we will only rarely place bids on the New York Stock Exchange (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNYSE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  Instead, we\\nwill respond to offers made directly to us at or below the NYSE bid.  If you wish to offer stock, have your broker call\\nMark Millard at 402-346-1400.  When a trade occurs, the broker can either record it in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthird market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or on the\\nNYSE.  We will favor purchase of the B shares if they are selling at more than a 2% discount to the A.  We will not\\nengage in transactions involving fewer than 10 shares of A or 50 shares of B.\\n</p>\\n<p>Please be clear about one point: We will never make purchases with the intention of stemming a decline in\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price.  Rather we will make them if and when we believe that they represent an attractive use of the\\nCompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money.  At best, repurchases are likely to have only a very minor effect on the future rate of gain in our\\nstock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The rest of Berkshire\\'s giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the\\nphilanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves take on the\\nresponsibility for their personal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $13.8 million in 1999,\\nincluding in-kind donations of $2.5 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual\\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.

Therefore, we are relocating to the Civic Auditorium (which is on Capitol Avenue between 18  and 19 ,th  th\\n</p>\\n<p>behind the Doubletree Hotel), the only other facility in Omaha offering the space we require.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Civic, however, is located in downtown Omaha, and we would create a parking and traffic nightmare if we\\nwere to meet there on a weekday.  We will, therefore, convene on Saturday, April 29, with the doors opening at 7 a.m.,\\nthe movie beginning at 8:30 and the meeting itself commencing at 9:30.

Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have scheduled the meeting in 2002 and 2003 on the customary first Saturday in May.  In 2001, however, the\\nCivic is already booked on that Saturday, so we will meet on April 28.  The Civic should fit our needs well on any\\nweekend, since there will then be more than ample parking in nearby lots and garages as well as on streets.  We will\\nalso be able to greatly enlarge the space we give exhibitors.  So, overcoming my normal commercial reticence, I will\\nsee that you have a wide display of Berkshire products at the Civic that you can purchase.  As a benchmark, in 1999\\nshareholders bought 3,059 pounds of See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s candy, $16,155 of World Book Products, 1,928 pairs of Dexter shoes, 895\\nsets of Quikut knives, 1,752 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo and 3,446 items of Berkshire apparel.  I know\\nyou can do better.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, we also initiated the sale of at least eight fractions of Executive Jet aircraft.

Ask an EJA representative at the Civic\\nabout viewing any of these planes.\\n</p>\\n<p>Dairy Queen will also be on hand at the Civic and again will donate all proceeds to the Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Miracle\\nNetwork.

I make a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquality check\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about once a week and can report\\nthat their rare T-bone (with a double order of hash browns) is still unequaled throughout the country.\\n</p>\\n<p>The usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the Omaha\\nGolden Spikes will play the Iowa Cubs.  Come early, because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when the real action takes place.  Those who\\nattended last year saw your Chairman pitch to Ernie Banks.\\n</p>\\n<p>This encounter proved to be the titanic duel that the sports world had long awaited.  After the first few pitches \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwhich were not my best, but when have I ever thrown my best? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I fired a brushback at Ernie just to let him know who\\nwas in command.  Ernie charged the mound, and I charged the plate.  But a clash was avoided because we became\\nexhausted before reaching each other.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ernie was dissatisfied with his performance last year and has been studying the game films all winter.  As you may\\nknow, Ernie had 512 home runs in his career as a Cub.  Now that he has spotted telltale weaknesses in my delivery, he\\nexpects to get #513 on April 29.  I, however, have learned new ways to disguise my \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflutterball.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Come and watch this\\nmatchup.\\n</p>\\n<p>I should add that I have extracted a promise from Ernie that he will not hit a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccome-backer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at me since I would\\nnever be able to duck in time to avoid it.  My reflexes are like Woody Allen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, who said his were so slow that he was\\nonce hit by a car being pushed by two guys.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our proxy statement contains instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of other\\ninformation that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>3\\n</p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2000 was $3.96 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both\\nour Class A and Class B stock by 6.5%.  Over the last 36 years (that is, since present management took over) per-\\nshare book value has grown from $19 to $40,442, a gain of 23.6% compounded annually.\\xe2\\x88\\x97\\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, we had a decent year, our book-value gain having outpaced the performance of the S&amp;P 500.\\nAnd, though this judgment is necessarily subjective, we believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain in per-share intrinsic value\\nmoderately exceeded its gain in book value.  (Intrinsic value, as well as other key investment and accounting terms\\nand concepts, are explained in our Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual on pages 59-66.  Intrinsic value is discussed on page 64.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, we completed two significant acquisitions that we negotiated in 1999 and initiated six more.\\nAll told, these purchases have cost us about $8 billion, with 97% of that amount paid in cash and 3% in stock.  The\\neight businesses we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve acquired have aggregate sales of about $13 billion and employ 58,000 people.  Still, we\\nincurred no debt in making these purchases, and our shares outstanding have increased only 1/3 of 1%.  Better yet,\\nwe remain awash in liquid assets and are both eager and ready for even larger acquisitions.\\n</p>\\n<p>I will detail our purchases in the next section of the report.  But I will tell you now that we have embraced\\nthe 21st century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint.  Try to control your\\nexcitement.\\n</p>\\n<p>On the minus side, policyholder growth at GEICO slowed to a halt as the year progressed.  It has become\\nmuch more expensive to obtain new business.  I told you last year that we would get our money\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth from\\nstepped-up advertising at GEICO in 2000, but I was wrong.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll examine the reasons later in the report.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another negative \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which has persisted for several years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is that we see our equity portfolio as only\\nmildly attractive.  We own stocks of some excellent businesses, but most of our holdings are fully priced and are\\nunlikely to deliver more than moderate returns in the future.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not alone in facing this problem:  The long-\\nterm prospect for equities in general is far from exciting.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there is the negative that recurs annually:  Charlie Munger, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vice Chairman and my\\npartner, and I are a year older than when we last reported to you.  Mitigating this adverse development is the\\nindisputable fact that the age of your top managers is increasing at a considerably lower rate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 percentage-wise \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthan is the case at almost all other major corporations.  Better yet, this differential will widen in the future.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I continue to aim at increasing Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share value at a rate that, over time, will\\nmodestly exceed the gain from owning the S&amp;P 500.  As the table on the facing page shows, a small annual\\nadvantage in our favor can, if sustained, produce an anything-but-small long-term advantage.  To reach our goal\\nwe will need to add a few good businesses to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stable each year, have the businesses we own generally\\ngain in value, and avoid any material increase in our outstanding shares.  We are confident about meeting the last\\ntwo objectives; the first will require some luck.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appropriate here to thank two groups that made my job both easy and fun last year \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 just as they do\\nevery year.  First, our operating managers continue to run their businesses in splendid fashion, which allows me to\\nspend my time allocating capital rather than supervising them.  (I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be good at that anyway.)\\n</p>\\n<p>                                                       \\n\\xe2\\x88\\x97All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares, the successor to the only stock that the\\n</p>\\n<p>company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>4\\n</p>\\n<p>Our managers are a very special breed.  At most large companies, the truly talented divisional managers\\nseldom have the job they really want.  Instead they yearn to become CEOs, either at their present employer or\\nelsewhere.  Indeed, if they stay put, they and their colleagues are likely to feel they have failed.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, our all-stars have exactly the jobs they want, ones that they hope and expect to keep\\nthroughout their business lifetimes.  They therefore concentrate solely on maximizing the long-term value of the\\nbusinesses that they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and love.  If the businesses succeed, they have succeeded.  And they stick with us:  In\\nour last 36 years, Berkshire has never had a manager of a significant subsidiary voluntarily leave to join another\\nbusiness.\\n</p>\\n<p>The other group to which I owe enormous thanks is the home-office staff.  After the eight acquisitions\\nmore than doubled our worldwide workforce to about 112,000, Charlie and I went soft last year and added one\\nmore person at headquarters.  (Charlie, bless him, never lets me forget Ben Franklin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA small leak can\\nsink a great ship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)  Now we have 13.8 people.\\n</p>\\n<p>This tiny band works miracles.  In 2000 it handled all of the details connected with our eight acquisitions,\\nprocessed extensive regulatory and tax filings (our tax return covers 4,896 pages), smoothly produced an annual\\nmeeting to which 25,000 tickets were issued, and accurately dispensed checks to 3,660 charities designated by our\\nshareholders.  In addition, the group dealt with all the routine tasks served up by a company with a revenue run-\\nrate of $40 billion and more than 300,000 owners.   And, to add to all of this, the other 12.8 are a delight to be\\naround.\\n</p>\\n<p>I should pay to have my job.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisitions of 2000\\n</p>\\n<p>Our acquisition technique at Berkshire is simplicity itself: We answer the phone.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also glad to report\\nthat it rings a bit more often now, because owners and/or managers increasingly wish to join their companies with\\nBerkshire.  Our acquisition criteria are set forth on page 23, and the number to call is 402-346-1400.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me tell you a bit about the businesses we have purchased during the past 14 months, starting with the\\ntwo transactions that were initiated in 1999, but closed in 2000.  (This list excludes some smaller purchases that\\nwere made by the managers of our subsidiaries and that, in most cases, will be integrated into their operations.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 I described the first purchase \\xe2\\x80\\x94 76% of MidAmerican Energy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report.  Because\\nof regulatory constraints on our voting privileges, we perform only a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone-line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d consolidation of\\nMidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings and equity in our financial statements.  If we instead fully consolidated\\nthe company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s figures, our revenues in 2000 would have been $5 billion greater than we\\nreported, though net income would remain the same.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 On November 23, 1999, I received a one-page fax from Bruce Cort that appended a Washington\\nPost article describing an aborted buyout of CORT Business Services.  Despite his name, Bruce\\nhas no connection with CORT.  Rather, he is an airplane broker who had sold Berkshire a jet in\\n1986 and who, before the fax, had not been in touch with me for about ten years.\\n</p>\\n<p>I knew nothing about CORT, but I immediately printed out its SEC filings and liked what I saw.\\nThat same day I told Bruce I had a possible interest and asked him to arrange a meeting with\\nPaul Arnold, CORT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO.  Paul and I got together on November 29, and I knew at once that we\\nhad the right ingredients for a purchase: a fine though unglamorous business, an outstanding\\nmanager, and a price (going by that on the failed deal) that made sense.\\n</p>\\n<p>Operating out of 117 showrooms, CORT is the national leader in \\xe2\\x80\\x9crent-to-rent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d furniture,\\nprimarily used in offices but also by temporary occupants of apartments.  This business, it should\\nbe noted, has no similarity to \\xe2\\x80\\x9crent-to-own\\xe2\\x80\\x9d operations, which usually involve the sale of home\\nfurnishings and electronics to people having limited income and poor credit.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>5\\n</p>\\n<p>We quickly purchased CORT for Wesco, our 80%-owned subsidiary, paying about $386 million\\nin cash.  You will find more details about CORT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations in Wesco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1999 and 2000 annual\\nreports.  Both Charlie and I enjoy working with Paul, and CORT looks like a good bet to beat our\\noriginal expectations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Early last year, Ron Ferguson of General Re put me in contact with Bob Berry, whose family had\\nowned U.S. Liability for 49 years.  This insurer, along with two sister companies, is a medium-\\nsized, highly-respected writer of unusual risks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexcess and surplus lines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in insurance jargon.\\nAfter Bob and I got in touch, we agreed by phone on a half-stock, half-cash deal.\\n</p>\\n<p>In recent years, Tom Nerney has managed the operation for the Berry family and has achieved a\\nrare combination of excellent growth and unusual profitability.  Tom is a powerhouse in other\\nways as well.  In addition to having four adopted children (two from Russia), he has an extended\\nfamily: the Philadelphia Belles, a young-teen girls basketball team that Tom coaches.  The team\\nhad a 62-4 record last year and finished second in the AAU national tournament.\\n</p>\\n<p>Few property-casualty companies are outstanding businesses.  We have far more than our share,\\nand U.S. Liability adds luster to the collection.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Ben Bridge Jeweler was another purchase we made by phone, prior to any face-to-face meeting\\nbetween me and the management.  Ed Bridge, who with his cousin, Jon, manages this 65-store\\nWest Coast retailer, is a friend of Barnett Helzberg, from whom we bought Helzberg Diamonds\\nin 1995.  Upon learning that the Bridge family proposed to sell its company, Barnett gave\\nBerkshire a strong recommendation.  Ed then called and explained his business to me, also\\nsending some figures, and we made a deal, again half for cash and half for stock.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ed and Jon are fourth generation owner-managers of a business started 89 years ago in Seattle.\\nBoth the business and the family\\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Herb and Bob, the fathers of Jon and Ed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 enjoy\\nextraordinary reputations.  Same-store sales have increased by 9%, 11%, 13%, 10%, 12%, 21%\\nand 7% over the past seven years, a truly remarkable record.\\n</p>\\n<p>It was vital to the family that the company operate in the future as in the past.  No one wanted\\nanother jewelry chain to come in and decimate the organization with ideas about synergy and\\ncost saving (which, though they would never work, were certain to be tried).  I told Ed and Jon\\nthat they would be in charge, and they knew I could be believed:  After all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obvious that your\\nChairman would be a disaster at actually running a store or selling jewelry (though there are\\nmembers of his family who have earned black belts as purchasers).\\n</p>\\n<p>In their typically classy way, the Bridges allocated a substantial portion of the proceeds from their\\nsale to the hundreds of co-workers who had helped the company achieve its success.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\nproud to be associated with both the family and the company.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In July we acquired Justin Industries, the leading maker of Western boots \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the\\nJustin, Tony Lama, Nocona, and Chippewa brands \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 and the premier producer of brick in Texas\\nand five neighboring states.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here again, our acquisition involved serendipity.  On May 4th, I received a fax from Mark Jones,\\na stranger to me, proposing that Berkshire join a group to acquire an unnamed company.  I faxed\\nhim back, explaining that with rare exceptions we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t invest with others, but would happily\\npay him a commission if he sent details and we later made a purchase.  He replied that the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmystery company\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Justin.  I then went to Fort Worth to meet John Roach, chairman of the\\ncompany and John Justin, who had built the business and was its major shareholder.  Soon after,\\nwe bought Justin for $570 million in cash.\\n</p>\\n<p>John Justin loved Justin Industries but had been forced to retire because of severe health problems\\n(which sadly led to his death in late February).  John was a class act \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 as a citizen, businessman\\nand human being.  Fortunately, he had groomed two outstanding managers, Harrold Melton at\\nAcme and Randy Watson at Justin Boot, each of whom runs his company autonomously.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>6\\n</p>\\n<p>Acme, the larger of the two operations, produces more than one billion bricks per year at its 22\\nplants, about 11.7% of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national output.  The brick business, however, is necessarily\\nregional, and in its territory Acme enjoys unquestioned leadership. When Texans are asked to\\nname a brand of brick, 75% respond Acme, compared to 16% for the runner-up.  (Before our\\npurchase, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have named a brand of brick.  Could you have?)  This brand recognition is\\nnot only due to Acme\\xe2\\x80\\x99s product quality, but also reflects many decades of extraordinary\\ncommunity service by both the company and John Justin.\\n</p>\\n<p>I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resist pointing out that Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose top management has long been mired in the\\n19th century \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is now one of the very few authentic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclicks-and-bricks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d businesses around.  We\\nwent into 2000 with GEICO doing significant business on the Internet, and then we added Acme.\\nYou can bet this move by Berkshire is making them sweat in Silicon Valley.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In June, Bob Shaw, CEO of Shaw Industries, the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest carpet manufacturer, came to\\nsee me with his partner, Julian Saul, and the CEO of a second company with which Shaw was\\nmulling a merger.  The potential partner, however, faced huge asbestos liabilities from past\\nactivities, and any deal depended on these being eliminated through insurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>The executives visiting me wanted Berkshire to provide a policy that would pay all future\\nasbestos costs.  I explained that though we could write an exceptionally large policy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 far larger\\nthan any other insurer would ever think of offering \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we would never issue a policy that lacked\\na cap.\\n</p>\\n<p>Bob and Julian decided that if we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to bet the ranch on the extent of the acquiree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nliability, neither did they.  So their deal died.  But my interest in Shaw was sparked, and a few\\nmonths later Charlie and I met with Bob to work out a purchase by Berkshire.  A key feature of\\nthe deal was that both Bob and Julian were to continue owning at least 5% of Shaw.  This leaves\\nus associated with the best in the business as shown by Bob and Julian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record: Each built a\\nlarge, successful carpet business before joining forces in 1998.\\n</p>\\n<p>Shaw has annual sales of about $4 billion, and we own 87.3% of the company.  Leaving aside our\\ninsurance operation, Shaw is by far our largest business.  Now, if people walk all over us, we\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In July, Bob Mundheim, a director of Benjamin Moore Paint, called to ask if Berkshire might\\nbe interested in acquiring it.  I knew Bob from Salomon, where he was general counsel during\\nsome difficult times, and held him in very high regard.  So my answer was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>In late August, Charlie and I met with Richard Roob and Yvan Dupuy, past and present CEOs of\\nBenjamin Moore.  We liked them; we liked the business; and we made a $1 billion cash offer on\\nthe spot.  In October, their board approved the transaction, and we completed it in December.\\nBenjamin Moore has been making paint for 117 years and has thousands of independent dealers\\nthat are a vital asset to its business.  Make sure you specify our product for your next paint job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Finally, in late December, we agreed to buy Johns Manville Corp. for about $1.8 billion.  This\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible odyssey over the last few decades \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 too multifaceted to be chronicled here\\n\\xef\\xa3\\xa7 was shaped by its long history as a manufacturer of asbestos products.  The much-publicized\\nhealth problems that affected many people exposed to asbestos led to JM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s declaring bankruptcy\\nin 1982.\\n</p>\\n<p>Subsequently, the bankruptcy court established a trust for victims, the major asset of which was a\\ncontrolling interest in JM.  The trust, which sensibly wanted to diversify its assets, agreed last\\nJune to sell the business to an LBO buyer.  In the end, though, the LBO group was unable to\\nobtain financing.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>7\\n</p>\\n<p>Consequently, the deal was called off on Friday, December 8th.  The following Monday, Charlie\\nand I called Bob Felise, chairman of the trust, and made an all-cash offer with no financing\\ncontingencies.

(Only in the sales presentations of investment banks do earnings move forever upward.)  We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care\\nabout the bumps; what matters are the overall results.  But the decisions of other people are sometimes affected by\\nthe near-term outlook, which can both spur sellers and temper the enthusiasm of purchasers who might otherwise\\ncompete with us.\\n</p>\\n<p>A second factor that helped us in 2000 was that the market for junk bonds dried up as the year progressed.\\nIn the two preceding years, junk bond purchasers had relaxed their standards, buying the obligations of ever-\\nweaker issuers at inappropriate prices.  The effects of this laxity were felt last year in a ballooning of defaults.  In\\nthis environment, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d buyers of businesses \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 those who wish to buy using only a sliver of equity \\xef\\xa3\\xa7\\nbecame unable to borrow all they thought they needed.  What they could still borrow, moreover, came at a high\\nprice.  Consequently, LBO operators became less aggressive in their bidding when businesses came up for sale last\\nyear.  Because we analyze purchases on an all-equity basis, our evaluations did not change, which means we\\nbecame considerably more competitive.\\n</p>\\n<p>Aside from the economic factors that benefited us, we now enjoy a major and growing advantage in\\nmaking acquisitions in that we are often the buyer of choice for the seller.  That fact, of course, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t assure a\\ndeal \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 sellers have to like our price, and we have to like their business and management \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 but it does help.\\n</p>\\n<p>We find it meaningful when an owner cares about whom he sells to.  We like to do business with someone\\nwho loves his company, not just the money that a sale will bring him (though we certainly understand why he likes\\nthat as well).  When this emotional attachment exists, it signals that important qualities will likely be found within\\nthe business: honest accounting, pride of product, respect for customers, and a loyal group of associates having a\\nstrong sense of direction.  The reverse is apt to be true, also.  When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a\\ntotal lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale, particularly when\\nthe seller is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial owner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  And if owners behave with little regard for their business and its people, their\\nconduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.\\n</p>\\n<p>When a business masterpiece has been created by a lifetime \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or several lifetimes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of unstinting care\\nand exceptional talent, it should be important to the owner what corporation is entrusted to carry on its history.\\nCharlie and I believe Berkshire provides an almost unique home.  We take our obligations to the people who\\ncreated a business very seriously, and Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership structure ensures that we can fulfill our promises.\\nWhen we tell John Justin that his business will remain headquartered in Fort Worth, or assure the Bridge family\\nthat its operation will not be merged with another jeweler, these sellers can take those promises to the bank.\\n</p>\\n<p>How much better it is for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpainter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a business Rembrandt to personally select its permanent home\\nthan to have a trust officer or uninterested heirs auction it off.  Throughout the years we have had great experiences\\nwith those who recognize that truth and apply it to their business creations.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll leave the auctions to others.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>8\\n</p>\\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Our main business \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though we have others of great importance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is insurance.  To understand\\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the\\nlong-term outlook for both of these factors.\\n</p>\\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because\\npremiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that\\ntime, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that\\nan insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an\\n\"underwriting loss,\" which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less\\nthan the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is\\nhigher than market rates for money.\\n</p>\\n<p>A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in\\nfiguring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company\\'s true cost\\nof float.  Errors of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these\\nmiscalculations flow directly into earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in\\nreserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what\\'s presented, and at times I have been\\namazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.  Both the income statements and balance\\nsheets of insurers can be minefields.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, we strive to be both consistent and conservative in our reserving.  But we will make\\nmistakes.  And we warn you that there is nothing symmetrical about surprises in the insurance business: They\\nalmost always are unpleasant.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninsurance operations since we entered the business 34 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company\\n(whose traditional lines are included in the segment \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOther Primary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  For the table we have calculated our float\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by adding net loss reserves, loss\\nadjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting\\ninsurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed\\nreinsurance.  (Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t panic, there won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a quiz.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Yearend Float (in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>Other Other\\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\\n</p>\\n<p>1967 20 20\\n1977 40 131 171\\n1987 701 807 1,508\\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pleased by the growth in our float during 2000 but not happy with its cost.  Over the years, our cost\\nof float has been very close to zero, with the underwriting profits realized in most years offsetting the occasional\\nterrible year such as 1984, when our cost was a staggering 19%.  In 2000, however, we had an underwriting loss of\\n$1.6 billion, which gave us a float cost of 6%.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect our float cost to fall in 2001\\n\\xef\\xa3\\xa7 perhaps substantially \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 in large part because of corrections in pricing at General Re that should increasingly be\\nfelt as the year progresses.  On a smaller scale, GEICO may experience the same improving trend.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are two factors affecting our cost of float that are very rare at other insurers but that now loom large\\nat Berkshire.  First, a few insurers that are currently experiencing large losses have offloaded a significant portion of</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>9\\n</p>\\n<p>these on us in a manner that penalizes our current earnings but gives us float we can use for many years to come.\\nAfter the loss that we incur in the first year of the policy, there are no further costs attached to this business.\\n</p>\\n<p>When these policies are properly priced, we welcome the pain-today, gain-tomorrow effects they have.  In\\n1999, $400 million of our underwriting loss (about 27.8% of the total) came from business of this kind and in 2000\\nthe figure was $482 million (34.4% of our loss).  We have no way of predicting how much similar business we will\\nwrite in the future, but what we do get will typically be in large chunks.  Because these transactions can materially\\ndistort our figures, we will tell you about them as they occur.\\n</p>\\n<p>Other reinsurers have little taste for this insurance.  They simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stomach what huge underwriting\\nlosses do to their reported results, even though these losses are produced by policies whose overall economics are\\ncertain to be favorable.  You should be careful, therefore, in comparing our underwriting results with those of other\\ninsurers.\\n</p>\\n<p>An even more significant item in our numbers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, again, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find much of elsewhere \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\narises from transactions in which we assume past losses of a company that wants to put its troubles behind it.  To\\nillustrate, the XYZ insurance company might have last year bought a policy obligating us to pay the first $1 billion\\nof losses and loss adjustment expenses from events that happened in, say, 1995 and earlier years.  These contracts\\ncan be very large, though we always require a cap on our exposure.  We entered into a number of such transactions\\nin 2000 and expect to close several more in 2001.\\n</p>\\n<p>Under GAAP accounting, this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cretroactive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d insurance neither benefits nor penalizes our current earnings.\\nInstead, we set up an asset called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an amount reflecting\\nthe difference between the premium we receive and the (higher) losses we expect to pay (for which reserves are\\nimmediately established).  We then amortize this asset by making annual charges to earnings that create equivalent\\nunderwriting losses.  You will find the amount of the loss that we incur from these transactions in both our\\nquarterly and annual management discussion.  By their nature, these losses will continue for many years, often\\nstretching into decades.  As an offset, though, we have the use of float \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 lots of it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clearly, float carrying an annual cost of this kind is not as desirable as float we generate from policies that\\nare expected to produce an underwriting profit (of which we have plenty).  Nevertheless, this retroactive insurance\\nshould be decent business for us.\\n</p>\\n<p>The net of all this is that a) I expect our cost of float to be very attractive in the future but b) rarely to\\nreturn to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno-cost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mode because of the annual charge that retroactive reinsurance will lay on us.  Also \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nobviously \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 the ultimate benefits that we derive from float will depend not only on its cost but, fully as important,\\nhow effectively we deploy it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our retroactive business is almost single-handedly the work of Ajit Jain, whose praises I sing annually.  It\\nis impossible to overstate how valuable Ajit is to Berkshire.  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about my health; worry about his.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, Ajit brought home a $2.4 billion reinsurance premium, perhaps the largest in history, from a\\npolicy that retroactively covers a major U.K. company.  Subsequently, he wrote a large policy protecting the Texas\\nRangers from the possibility that Alex Rodriguez will become permanently disabled.  As sports fans know, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA-Rod\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwas signed for $252 million, a record, and we think that our policy probably also set a record for disability\\ninsurance.  We cover many other sports figures as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>In another example of his versatility, Ajit last fall negotiated a very interesting deal with Grab.com, an\\nInternet company whose goal was to attract millions of people to its site and there to extract information from them\\nthat would be useful to marketers.  To lure these people, Grab.com held out the possibility of a $1 billion prize\\n(having a $170 million present value) and we insured its payment.  A message on the site explained that the\\nchance of anyone winning the prize was low, and indeed no one won.  But the possibility of a win was far from nil.\\n</p>\\n<p>Writing such a policy, we receive a modest premium, face the possibility of a huge loss, and get good\\nodds. Very few insurers like that equation.  And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unable to cure their unhappiness by reinsurance.  Because\\neach policy has unusual \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 and sometimes unique \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 characteristics, insurers can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lay off the occasional shock loss</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Therefore, any insurance CEO doing a piece of business like this\\nmust run the small, but real, risk of a horrible quarterly earnings number, one that he would not enjoy explaining to\\nhis board or shareholders.  Charlie and I, however, like any proposition that makes compelling mathematical sense,\\nregardless of its effect on reported earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>At General Re, the news has turned considerably better:  Ron Ferguson, along with Joe Brandon, Tad\\nMontross, and a talented supporting cast took many actions during 2000 to bring that company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profitability back\\nto past standards.  Though our pricing is not fully corrected, we have significantly repriced business that was\\nseverely unprofitable or dropped it altogether.  If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no mega-catastrophe in 2001, General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float cost\\nshould fall materially.\\n</p>\\n<p>The last couple of years haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been any fun for Ron and his crew.

Better yet, it has managers who will make the most of them.\\n</p>\\n<p>In aggregate, our smaller insurance operations produced an excellent underwriting profit in 2000 while\\ngenerating significant float \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just as they have done for more than a decade.  If these companies were a single and\\nseparate operation, people would consider it an outstanding insurer.

Last year I\\nthanked Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster, and I again do so.  In addition, we now also owe\\nthanks to Tom Nerney at U.S. Liability and Michael Stearns, the new head of Cypress.\\n</p>\\n<p>You may notice that Brad Kinstler, who was CEO of Cypress and whose praises I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sung in the past, is no\\nlonger in the list above.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because we needed a new manager at Fechheimer Bros., our Cincinnati-based\\nuniform company, and called on Brad.

I was wrong:  The extra money we spent did not produce a commensurate increase in\\ninquiries.

       "  '10': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>11\\n</p>\\n<p>The financial consequences of these boners are regularly dumped into massive restructuring charges or\\nwrite-offs that are casually waved off as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnonrecurring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Managements just love these.  Indeed, in recent years it\\nhas seemed that no earnings statement is complete without them.  The origins of these charges, though, are never\\nexplored.  When it comes to corporate blunders, CEOs invoke the concept of the Virgin Birth.\\n</p>\\n<p>To get back to our examination of GEICO:  There are at least four factors that could account for the\\nincreased costs we experienced in obtaining new business last year, and all probably contributed in some manner.\\n</p>\\n<p>First, in our advertising we have pushed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrequency\\xe2\\x80\\x9d very hard, and we probably overstepped in certain\\nmedia.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always known that increasing the number of messages through any medium would eventually\\nproduce diminishing returns.  The third ad in an hour on a given cable channel is simply not going to be as effective\\nas the first.\\n</p>\\n<p>Second, we may have already picked much of the low-hanging fruit.  Clearly, the willingness to do\\nbusiness with a direct marketer of insurance varies widely among individuals:  Indeed, some percentage of\\nAmericans \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 particularly older ones \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 are reluctant to make direct purchases of any kind.  Over the years,\\nhowever, this reluctance will ebb.  A new generation with new habits will find the savings from direct purchase of\\ntheir auto insurance too compelling to ignore.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another factor that surely decreased the conversion of inquiries into sales was stricter underwriting by\\nGEICO.  Both the frequency and severity of losses increased during the year, and rates in certain areas became\\ninadequate, in some cases substantially so. In these instances, we necessarily tightened our underwriting standards.\\nThis tightening, as well as the many rate increases we put in during the year, made our offerings less attractive to\\nsome prospects.\\n</p>\\n<p>A high percentage of callers, it should be emphasized, can still save money by insuring with us.\\nUnderstandably, however, some prospects will switch to save $200 per year but will not switch to save $50.\\nTherefore, rate increases that bring our prices closer to those of our competitors will hurt our acceptance rate, even\\nwhen we continue to offer the best deal.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, the competitive picture changed in at least one important respect:  State Farm \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 by far the largest\\npersonal auto insurer, with about 19% of the market \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been very slow to raise prices.  Its costs, however, are\\nclearly increasing right along with those of the rest of the industry.  Consequently, State Farm had an underwriting\\nloss last year from auto insurance (including rebates to policyholders) of 18% of premiums, compared to 4% at\\nGEICO.  Our loss produced a float cost for us of 6.1%, an unsatisfactory result.  (Indeed, at GEICO we expect float,\\nover time, to be free.)  But we estimate that State Farm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float cost in 2000 was about 23%.  The willingness of the\\nlargest player in the industry to tolerate such a cost makes the economics difficult for other participants.\\n</p>\\n<p>That does not take away from the fact that State Farm is one of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest business stories.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nurged that the company be studied at business schools because it has achieved fabulous success while following a\\npath that in many ways defies the dogma of those institutions.  Studying counter-evidence is a highly useful activity,\\nthough not one always greeted with enthusiasm at citadels of learning.\\n</p>\\n<p>State Farm was launched in 1922, by a 45-year-old, semi-retired Illinois farmer, to compete with long-\\nestablished insurers \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 haughty institutions in New York, Philadelphia and Hartford \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 that possessed\\noverwhelming advantages in capital, reputation, and distribution.  Because State Farm is a mutual company, its\\nboard members and managers could not be owners, and it had no access to capital markets during its years of fast\\ngrowth.  Similarly, the business never had the stock options or lavish salaries that many people think vital if an\\nAmerican enterprise is to attract able managers and thrive.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the end, however, State Farm eclipsed all its competitors.  In fact, by 1999 the company had amassed a\\ntangible net worth exceeding that of all but four American businesses.

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because our \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctax cost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d upon sale would include both what we paid for the\\nbusiness and all earnings it subsequently retained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Contrast that situation to what happens when we own an investment in a marketable security.  There, if we\\nown a 10% stake in a business earning $10 million after tax, our $1 million share of the earnings is subject to\\nadditional state and federal taxes of (1) about $140,000 if it is distributed to us (our tax rate on most dividends is\\n14%); or (2) no less than $350,000 if the $1 million is retained and subsequently captured by us in the form of a\\ncapital gain (on which our tax rate is usually about 35%, though it sometimes approaches 40%).  We may defer\\npaying the $350,000 by not immediately realizing our gain, but eventually we must pay the tax.  In effect, the\\ngovernment is our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d twice when we own part of a business through a stock investment, but only once when\\nwe own at least 80%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Leaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical.  Indeed, the\\nformula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by\\na very smart man in about 600 B.C.  (though he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).\\n</p>\\n<p>The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca bird in\\nthe hand is worth two in the bush.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions.  How certain\\nare you that there are indeed birds in the bush?  When will they emerge and how many will there be?  What is the\\nrisk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)?  If you can answer these three\\nquestions, you will know the maximum value of the bush \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 and the maximum number of the birds you now\\npossess that should be offered for it.  And, of course, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t literally think birds.  Think dollars.\\n</p>\\n<p>Aesop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into dollars, is immutable.  It applies to outlays\\nfor farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants.  And neither the advent of the steam\\nengine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota \\xe2\\x80\\x94 nor will the\\nInternet.  Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital\\nthroughout the universe.\\n</p>\\n<p>Common yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or to book value, and even growth\\nrates have nothing to do with valuation except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash\\nflows into and from the business.  Indeed, growth can destroy value if it requires cash inputs in the early years of a\\nproject or enterprise that exceed the discounted value of the cash that those assets will generate in later years.\\nMarket commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrowth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d styles as contrasting\\napproaches to investment are displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication.  Growth is simply a component \\xef\\xa3\\xa7\\nusually a plus, sometimes a minus \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 in the value equation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Alas, though Aesop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposition and the third variable \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 that is, interest rates \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 are simple, plugging in\\nnumbers for the other two variables is a difficult task.  Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a\\nrange of possibilities is the better approach.\\n</p>\\n<p>Usually, the range must be so wide that no useful conclusion can be reached.  Occasionally, though, even\\nvery conservative estimates about the future emergence of birds reveal that the price quoted is startlingly low in\\nrelation to value.  (Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call this phenomenon the IBT \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 Inefficient Bush Theory.)  To be sure, an investor needs\\nsome general understanding of business economics as well as the ability to think independently to reach a well-\\nfounded positive conclusion.  But the investor does not need brilliance nor blinding insights.\\n</p>\\n<p>At the other extreme, there are many times when the most brilliant of investors can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t muster a conviction\\nabout the birds to emerge, not even when a very broad range of estimates is employed.  This kind of uncertainty\\nfrequently occurs when new businesses and rapidly changing industries are under examination.  In cases of this sort,\\nany capital commitment must be labeled speculative.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>14\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, speculation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in which the focus is not on what an asset will produce but rather on what the next\\nfellow will pay for it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is neither illegal, immoral nor un-American.  But it is not a game in which Charlie and I\\nwish to play.  We bring nothing to the party, so why should we expect to take anything home?\\n</p>\\n<p>The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still\\nfurther when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs.  Nothing sedates rationality like large doses\\nof effortless money.  After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that\\nof Cinderella at the ball.  They know that overstaying the festivities \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 that is, continuing to speculate in companies\\nthat have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 will eventually bring on\\npumpkins and mice.  But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party.  Therefore, the\\ngiddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem, though: They are dancing in\\na room in which the clocks have no hands.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, we commented on the exuberance \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 and, yes, it was irrational \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 that prevailed, noting that\\ninvestor expectations had grown to be several multiples of probable returns.  One piece of evidence came from a\\nPaine Webber-Gallup survey of investors conducted in December 1999, in which the participants were asked their\\nopinion about the annual returns investors could expect to realize over the decade ahead.  Their answers averaged\\n19%.  That, for sure, was an irrational expectation:  For American business as a whole, there couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possibly be\\nenough birds in the 2009 bush to deliver such a return.\\n</p>\\n<p>Far more irrational still were the huge valuations that market participants were then putting on businesses\\nalmost certain to end up being of modest or no value.  Yet investors, mesmerized by soaring stock prices and\\nignoring all else, piled into these enterprises.  It was as if some virus, racing wildly among investment professionals\\nas well as amateurs, induced hallucinations in which the values of stocks in certain sectors became decoupled from\\nthe values of the businesses that underlay them.\\n</p>\\n<p>This surreal scene was accompanied by much loose talk about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalue creation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  We readily acknowledge\\nthat there has been a huge amount of true value created in the past decade by new or young businesses, and that\\nthere is much more to come.  But value is destroyed, not created, by any business that loses money over its lifetime,\\nno matter how high its interim valuation may get.\\n</p>\\n<p>What actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer, often on a massive scale.  By shamelessly\\nmerchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the\\npublic to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates).  The fact is that a bubble market has allowed\\nthe creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for\\nthem.  Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promoters.  At bottom, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness\\nmodel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers\\nacted as eager postmen.\\n</p>\\n<p>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble.  And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns\\nsome very old lessons:  First, many in Wall Street \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 a community in which quality control is not prized \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 will sell\\ninvestors anything they will buy.  Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, we make no attempt to pick the few winners that will emerge from an ocean of unproven\\nenterprises.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not smart enough to do that, and we know it.  Instead, we try to apply Aesop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2,600-year-old\\nequation to opportunities in which we have reasonable confidence as to how many birds are in the bush and when\\nthey will emerge  (a formulation that my grandsons would probably update to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA girl in a convertible is worth five\\nin the phonebook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  Obviously, we can never precisely predict the timing of cash flows in and out of a business or\\ntheir exact amount.  We try, therefore, to keep our estimates conservative and to focus on industries where business\\nsurprises are unlikely to wreak havoc on owners.  Even so, we make many mistakes:  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the fellow, remember,\\nwho thought he understood the future economics of trading stamps, textiles, shoes and second-tier department\\nstores.\\n</p>\\n<p>Lately, the most promising \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbushes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d have been negotiated transactions for entire businesses, and that\\npleases us.  You should clearly understand, however, that these acquisitions will at best provide us only reasonable\\nreturns.  Really juicy results from negotiated deals can be anticipated only when capital markets are severely\\nconstrained and the whole business world is pessimistic.

Both\\ncompanies are run by their remarkable founders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Al Ueltschi at FSI is now 83 and continues to operate at full throttle.  Though I am not a fan of stock splits,\\nI am planning to split Al\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age 2-for-1 when he hits 100.  (If it works, guess who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next.)\\n</p>\\n<p>We spent $272 million on flight simulators in 2000, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll spend a similar amount this year.

Rich Santulli is\\nthe dynamo behind this business.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year I told you that EJA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recurring revenue from monthly management fees and hourly usage grew\\nby 46% in 1999.  In 2000 the growth was 49%.  I also told you that this was a low-margin business, in which\\nsurvivors will be few.

Given that cargo, I applaud Rich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insistence on unusually high amounts of\\npilot training (an average of 23 days a year).  In addition, our pilots cement their skills by flying 800 or so hours a\\nyear.  Finally, each flies only one model of aircraft, which means our crews do no switching around among planes\\nwith different cockpit and flight characteristics.\\n</p>\\n<p>EJA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business continues to be constrained by the availability of new aircraft.  Still, our customers will\\ntake delivery of more than 50 new jets in 2001, 7% of world output.

To depict\\nsomething closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept of \"look-\\nthrough\" earnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported on page 15; plus; (2)\\nour share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in\\nour profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees\\nhad instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating \"operating earnings\" here, we exclude purchase-accounting\\nadjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\\n</p>\\n<p>The following table sets forth our 2000 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can be no\\nmore than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.

       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>18\\n</p>\\n<p>One further thought while I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on my soapbox: Charlie and I think it is both deceptive and dangerous for\\nCEOs to predict growth rates for their companies.  They are, of course, frequently egged on to do so by both\\nanalysts and their own investor relations departments.  They should resist, however, because too often these\\npredictions lead to trouble.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine for a CEO to have his own internal goals and, in our view, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even appropriate for the CEO to\\npublicly express some hopes about the future, if these expectations are accompanied by sensible caveats.  But for a\\nmajor corporation to predict that its per-share earnings will grow over the long term at, say, 15% annually is to court\\ntrouble.\\n</p>\\n<p>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by a very small percentage of\\nlarge businesses.  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a test:  Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest earning companies from 1970 or 1980\\nand tabulate how many have increased per-share earnings by 15% annually since those dates.  You will find that\\nonly a handful have.  I would wager you a very significant sum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable\\ncompanies in 2000 will attain 15% annual growth in earnings-per-share over the next 20 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>The problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that they spread unwarranted optimism.  Even more\\ntroublesome is the fact that they corrode CEO behavior.  Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many\\ninstances in which CEOs engaged in uneconomic operating maneuvers so that they could meet earnings targets they\\nhad announced.  Worse still, after exhausting all that operating acrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide\\nvariety of accounting games to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake the numbers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing:\\nOnce a company moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to\\nengage in further accounting maneuvers that must be even more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheroic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  These can turn fudging into fraud.\\n(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors with fancy predictions.  A few\\nof these managers will prove prophetic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but others will turn out to be congenital optimists, or even charlatans.\\nUnfortunately, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not easy for investors to know in advance which species they are dealing with.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve warned you in the past that you should not believe everything you read or hear about Berkshire \\xef\\xa3\\xa7\\neven when it is published or broadcast by a prestigious news organization.  Indeed, erroneous reports are\\nparticularly dangerous when they are circulated by highly-respected members of the media, simply because most\\nreaders and listeners know these outlets to be generally credible and therefore believe what they say.\\n</p>\\n<p>An example is a glaring error about Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities that appeared in the December 29 issue of The\\nWall Street Journal, a generally excellent paper that I have for all of my life found useful.  On the front page (and\\nabove the fold, as they say) The Journal published a news brief that said, in unequivocal terms, that we were buying\\nbonds of Conseco and Finova.  This item directed the reader to the lead story of the Money and Investing section.\\nThere, in the second paragraph of the story, The Journal reported, again without any qualification, that Berkshire\\nwas buying Conseco and Finova bonds, adding that Berkshire had invested \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseveral hundred million dollars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\neach.  Only in the 18th paragraph of the story (which by that point had jumped to an inside page) did the paper hedge\\na bit, saying that our Conseco purchases had been disclosed by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople familiar with the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Well, not that familiar.  True, we had purchased bonds and bank debt of Finova \\xef\\xa3\\xa7 though the report was\\nwildly inaccurate as to the amount.  But to this day neither Berkshire nor I have ever bought a share of stock or a\\nbond of Conseco.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire is normally covered by a Journal reporter in Chicago who is both accurate and conscientious.

The rest of Berkshire\\'s giving is done by our subsidiaries, which\\nstick to the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners\\nthemselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities).

Except for that interlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.\\n</p>\\n<p>For the next couple of years, the Civic is our only choice.  We must therefore hold the meeting on either\\nSaturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare that would occur on a weekday.  Shortly, however,\\nOmaha will have a new Convention Center with ample parking.  Assuming that the Center is then available to us, I\\nwill poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to a Monday meeting.

Over the last 37 years (that is, since present management took over)\\nper-share book value has grown from $19 to $37,920, a rate of 22.6% compounded annually.\\xe2\\x88\\x97\\n</p>\\n<p>Per-share intrinsic grew somewhat faster than book value during these 37 years, and in 2001 it probably\\ndecreased a bit less.  We explain intrinsic value in our Owner\\xc2\\x92s Manual, which begins on page 62.  I urge new\\nshareholders to read this manual to become familiar with Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s key economic principles.\\n</p>\\n<p>Two years ago, reporting on 1999, I said that we had experienced both the worst absolute and relative\\nperformance in our history.  I added that \\xc2\\x93relative results are what concern us,\\xc2\\x94 a viewpoint I\\xc2\\x92ve had since forming\\nmy first investment partnership on May 5, 1956.  Meeting with my seven founding limited partners that evening, I\\ngave them a short paper titled \\xc2\\x93The Ground Rules\\xc2\\x94 that included this sentence: \\xc2\\x93Whether we do a good job or a\\npoor job is to be measured against the general experience in securities.\\xc2\\x94  We initially used the Dow Jones Industrials\\nas our benchmark, but shifted to the S&amp;P 500 when that index became widely used.  Our comparative record since\\n1965 is chronicled on the facing page; last year Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s advantage was 5.7 percentage points.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some people disagree with our focus on relative figures, arguing that \\xc2\\x93you can\\xc2\\x92t eat relative performance.\\xc2\\x94\\nBut if you expect \\xc2\\x96 as Charlie Munger, Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s Vice Chairman, and I do \\xc2\\x96 that owning the S&amp;P 500 will\\nproduce reasonably satisfactory results over time, it follows that, for long-term investors, gaining small advantages\\nannually over that index must prove rewarding.  Just as you can eat well throughout the year if you own a profitable,\\nbut highly seasonal, business such as See\\xc2\\x92s (which loses considerable money during the summer months) so, too,\\ncan you regularly feast on investment returns that beat the averages, however variable the absolute numbers may be.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though our corporate performance last year was satisfactory, my performance was anything but.  I manage\\nmost of Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s equity portfolio, and my results were poor, just as they have been for several years.  Of even\\nmore importance, I allowed General Re to take on business without a safeguard I knew was important, and on\\nSeptember 11th, this error caught up with us.  I\\xc2\\x92ll tell you more about my mistake later and what we are doing to\\ncorrect it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another of my 1956 Ground Rules remains applicable: \\xc2\\x93I cannot promise results to partners.\\xc2\\x94  But Charlie\\nand I can promise that your economic result from Berkshire will parallel ours during the period of your ownership:\\nWe will not take cash compensation, restricted stock or option grants that would make our results superior to yours.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, I will keep well over 99% of my net worth in Berkshire.  My wife and I have never sold a\\nshare nor do we intend to.  Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which\\nshareholders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters, and other higher-ups who fathered these\\ndisasters have walked away with extraordinary wealth.  Indeed, many of these people were urging investors to buy\\nshares while concurrently dumping their own, sometimes using methods that hid their actions. To their shame, these\\nbusiness leaders view shareholders as patsies, not partners.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though Enron has become the symbol for shareholder abuse, there is no shortage of egregious conduct\\nelsewhere in corporate America.  One story I\\xc2\\x92ve heard illustrates the all-too-common attitude of managers toward\\n</p>\\n<p>                                                          \\n\\xe2\\x88\\x97All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares, the successor to the only stock that the\\n</p>\\n<p>company had outstanding before 1996.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>4\\n</p>\\n<p>owners: A gorgeous woman slinks up to a CEO at a party and through moist lips purrs, \\xc2\\x93I\\xc2\\x92ll do anything \\xc2\\x96 anything\\n\\xc2\\x96 you want.  Just tell me what you would like.\\xc2\\x94  With no hesitation, he replies, \\xc2\\x93Reprice my options.\\xc2\\x94\\n</p>\\n<p>One final thought about Berkshire: In the future we won\\xc2\\x92t come close to replicating our past record.  To be\\nsure, Charlie and I will strive for above-average performance and will not be satisfied with less.  But two conditions\\nat Berkshire are far different from what they once were: Then, we could often buy businesses and securities at much\\nlower valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were then working with far less money than we now\\nhave.  Some years back, a good $10 million idea could do wonders for us (witness our investment in Washington\\nPost in 1973 or GEICO in 1976).  Today, the combination of ten such ideas and a triple in the value of each would\\nincrease the net worth of Berkshire by only \\xc2\\xbc of 1%.  We need \\xc2\\x93elephants\\xc2\\x94 to make significant gains now \\xc2\\x96 and\\nthey are hard to find.\\n</p>\\n<p>On the positive side, we have as fine an array of operating managers as exists at any company.  (You can\\nread about many of them in a new book by Robert P. Miles: The Warren Buffett CEO.) In large part, moreover, they\\nare running businesses with economic characteristics ranging from good to superb.  The ability, energy and loyalty\\nof these managers is simply extraordinary.  We now have completed 37 Berkshire years without having a CEO of\\nan operating business elect to leave us to work elsewhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our star-studded group grew in 2001.  First, we completed the purchases of two businesses that we had\\nagreed to buy in 2000 \\xc2\\x96 Shaw and Johns Manville.  Then we acquired two others, MiTek and XTRA, and\\ncontracted to buy two more: Larson-Juhl, an acquisition that has just closed, and Fruit of the Loom, which will close\\nshortly if creditors approve our offer.  All of these businesses are led by smart, seasoned and trustworthy CEOs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, all of our purchases last year were for cash, which means our shareholders became owners of\\nthese additional businesses without relinquishing any interest in the fine companies they already owned.  We will\\ncontinue to follow our familiar formula, striving to increase the value of the excellent businesses we have, adding\\nnew businesses of similar quality, and issuing shares only grudgingly.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisitions of 2001\\n</p>\\n<p>A few days before last year\\xc2\\x92s annual meeting, I received a heavy package from St. Louis, containing an\\nunprepossessing chunk of metal whose function I couldn\\xc2\\x92t imagine. There was a letter in the package, though, from\\nGene Toombs, CEO of a company called MiTek.  He explained that MiTek is the world\\xc2\\x92s leading producer of this\\nthing I\\xc2\\x92d received, a \\xc2\\x93connector plate,\\xc2\\x94 which is used in making roofing trusses.  Gene also said that the U.K. parent\\nof MiTek wished to sell the company and that Berkshire seemed to him the ideal buyer.  Liking the sound of his\\nletter, I gave Gene a call.  It took me only a minute to realize that he was our kind of manager and MiTek our kind\\nof business.  We made a cash offer to the U.K. owner and before long had a deal.\\n</p>\\n<p>Gene\\xc2\\x92s managerial crew is exceptionally enthusiastic about the company and wanted to participate in the\\npurchase.  Therefore, we arranged for 55 members of the MiTek team to buy 10% of the company, with each\\nputting up a minimum of $100,000 in cash.  Many borrowed money so they could participate.\\n</p>\\n<p>As they would not be if they had options, all of these managers are true owners.  They face the downside of\\ndecisions as well as the upside.  They incur a cost of capital.  And they can\\xc2\\x92t \\xc2\\x93reprice\\xc2\\x94 their stakes: What they paid\\nis what they live with.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I love the high-grade, truly entrepreneurial attitude that exists at MiTek, and we predict it will\\nbe a winner for all involved.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>In early 2000, my friend, Julian Robertson, announced that he would terminate his investment partnership,\\nTiger Fund, and that he would liquidate it entirely except for four large holdings.  One of these was XTRA, a\\nleading lessor of truck trailers.  I then called Julian, asking whether he might consider selling his XTRA block or\\nwhether, for that matter, the company\\xc2\\x92s management might entertain an offer for the entire company.  Julian\\nreferred me to Lew Rubin, XTRA\\xc2\\x92s CEO.  He and I had a nice conversation, but it was apparent that no deal was to\\nbe done.\\n</p>\\n<p>Then in June 2001, Julian called to say that he had decided to sell his XTRA shares, and I resumed\\nconversations with Lew.  The XTRA board accepted a proposal we made, which was to be effectuated through a\\ntender offer expiring on September 11th.  The tender conditions included the usual \\xc2\\x93out,\\xc2\\x94 allowing us to withdraw if</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Throughout much of the 11th, Lew went through a\\nparticularly wrenching experience: First, he had a son-in-law working in the World Trade Center who couldn\\xc2\\x92t be\\nlocated; and second, he knew we had the option of backing away from our purchase.  The story ended happily:\\nLew\\xc2\\x92s son-in-law escaped serious harm, and Berkshire completed the transaction.\\n</p>\\n<p>Trailer leasing is a cyclical business but one in which we should earn decent returns over time.

Craig had bought the company in 1981 (after first working at its manufacturing plant while\\nattending college) and thereafter increased its sales from $3 million to $300 million.  Though I had never heard of\\nLarson-Juhl before Craig\\xc2\\x92s call, a few minutes talk with him made me think we would strike a deal.  He was\\nstraightforward in describing the business, cared about who bought it, and was realistic as to price.

In ten days\\nwe had signed a contract.\\n</p>\\n<p>Larson-Juhl serves about 18,000 framing shops in the U.S. and is also the industry leader in Canada and\\nmuch of Europe.  We expect to see opportunities for making complementary acquisitions in the future.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>As I write this letter, creditors are considering an offer we have made for Fruit of the Loom.  The company\\nentered bankruptcy a few years back, a victim both of too much debt and poor management.  And, a good many\\nyears before that, I had some Fruit of the Loom experience of my own.\\n</p>\\n<p>In August 1955, I was one of five employees, including two secretaries, working for the three managers of\\nGraham-Newman Corporation, a New York investment company.  Graham-Newman controlled Philadelphia and\\nReading Coal and Iron (\\xc2\\x93P&amp;R\\xc2\\x94), an anthracite producer that had excess cash, a tax loss carryforward, and a\\ndeclining business.  At the time, I had a significant portion of my limited net worth invested in P&amp;R shares,\\nreflecting my faith in the business talents of my bosses, Ben Graham, Jerry Newman and Howard (Micky) Newman.\\n</p>\\n<p>This faith was rewarded when P&amp;R purchased the Union Underwear Company from Jack Goldfarb for $15\\nmillion.  Union (though it was then only a licensee of the name) produced Fruit of the Loom underwear.  The\\ncompany possessed $5 million in cash \\xc2\\x96 $2.5 million of which P&amp;R used for the purchase \\xc2\\x96 and was earning about\\n$3 million pre-tax, earnings that could be sheltered by the tax position of P&amp;R.  And, oh yes: Fully $9 million of the\\nremaining $12.5 million due was satisfied by non-interest-bearing notes, payable from 50% of any earnings Union\\nhad in excess of $1 million.  (Those were the days; I get goosebumps just thinking about such deals.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Subsequently, Union bought the licensor of the Fruit of the Loom name and, along with P&amp;R, was merged\\ninto Northwest Industries.  Fruit went on to achieve annual pre-tax earnings exceeding $200 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>John Holland was responsible for Fruit\\xc2\\x92s operations in its most bountiful years.  In 1996, however, John\\nretired, and management loaded the company with debt, in part to make a series of acquisitions that proved\\ndisappointing.  Bankruptcy followed.  John was then rehired, and he undertook a major reworking of operations.\\nBefore John\\xc2\\x92s return, deliveries were chaotic, costs soared and relations with key customers deteriorated.  While\\ncorrecting these problems, John also reduced employment from a bloated 40,000 to 23,000.  In short, he\\xc2\\x92s been\\nrestoring the old Fruit of the Loom, albeit in a much more competitive environment.\\n</p>\\n<p>Stepping into Fruit\\xc2\\x92s bankruptcy proceedings, we made a proposal to creditors to which we attached no\\nfinancing conditions, even though our offer had to remain outstanding for many months.  We did, however, insist on\\na very unusual proviso: John had to be available to continue serving as CEO after we took over.  To us, John and\\nthe brand are Fruit\\xc2\\x92s key assets.\\n</p>\\n<p>I was helped in this transaction by my friend and former boss, Micky Newman, now 81.

But \\xc2\\x96 would you believe it? \\xc2\\x96 Acme was the second purchase of P&amp;R, an\\nacquisition that took place just before I left Graham-Newman in the spring of 1956.  The price was $3.2 million,\\npart of it again paid with non-interest bearing notes, for a business with sales of $7 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>After P&amp;R merged with Northwest, Acme grew to be the world\\xc2\\x92s largest bootmaker, delivering annual\\nprofits many multiples of what the company had cost P&amp;R.

In that\\nregard, here\\xc2\\x92s a postscript to a story I told you two years ago about R.C. Willey\\xc2\\x92s move to Boise.  As you may\\nremember, Bill Child, R.C. Willey\\xc2\\x92s chairman, wanted to extend his home-furnishings operation beyond Utah, a\\nstate in which his company does more than $300 million of business (up, it should be noted, from $250,000 when\\nBill took over 48 years ago).  The company achieved this dominant position, moreover, with a \\xc2\\x93closed on Sunday\\xc2\\x94\\npolicy that defied conventional retailing wisdom.  I was skeptical that this policy could succeed in Boise or, for that\\nmatter, anyplace outside of Utah.  After all, Sunday is the day many consumers most like to shop.\\n</p>\\n<p>Bill then insisted on something extraordinary: He would invest $11 million of his own money to build the\\nBoise store and would sell it to Berkshire at cost (without interest!) if the venture succeeded.  If it failed, Bill would\\nkeep the store and eat the loss on its disposal.  As I told you in the 1999 annual report, the store immediately\\nbecame a huge success \\xe2\\x80\\x95 and it has since grown.\\n</p>\\n<p>Shortly after the Boise opening, Bill suggested we try Las Vegas, and this time I was even more skeptical.\\nHow could we do business in a metropolis of that size and be closed on Sundays, a day that all of our competitors\\nwould be exploiting?  Buoyed by the Boise experience, however, we proceeded to locate in Henderson, a\\nmushrooming city adjacent to Las Vegas.\\n</p>\\n<p>The result: This store outsells all others in the R.C. Willey chain, doing a volume of business that far\\nexceeds the volume of any competitor and that is twice what I had anticipated.  I cut the ribbon at the grand opening\\nin October \\xc2\\x96 this was after a \\xc2\\x93soft\\xc2\\x94 opening and a few weeks of exceptional sales \\xc2\\x96 and, just as I did at Boise, I\\nsuggested to the crowd that the new store was my idea.\\n</p>\\n<p>It didn\\xc2\\x92t work.  Today, when I pontificate about retailing, Berkshire people just say, \\xc2\\x93What does Bill\\nthink?\\xc2\\x94  (I\\xc2\\x92m going to draw the line, however, if he suggests that we also close on Saturdays.)\\n</p>\\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Our main business \\xc2\\x97 though we have others of great importance \\xc2\\x97 is insurance.  To understand\\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the\\nlong-term outlook for both of these factors.\\n</p>\\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because\\npremiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that\\ntime, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that\\nan insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an\\n\"underwriting loss,\" which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less\\nthan the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is\\nhigher than market rates for money.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>7\\n</p>\\n<p>Historically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost.

For the table we have calculated our float \\xc2\\x97\\nwhich we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \\xc2\\x97 by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment\\nreserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-\\nrelated receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.\\n(Got that?)\\n</p>\\n<p>Yearend Float (in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>Other Other\\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\\n</p>\\n<p>1967 20 20\\n1977 40 131 171\\n1987 701 807 1,508\\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\\n2001 4,251 19,310 11,262 685 35,508\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year I told you that, barring a mega-catastrophe, our cost of float would probably drop from its 2000\\nlevel of 6%.  I had in mind natural catastrophes when I said that, but instead we were hit by a man-made catastrophe\\non September 11th \\xc2\\x96 an event that delivered the insurance industry its largest loss in history.  Our float cost therefore\\ncame in at a staggering 12.8%.  It was our worst year in float cost since 1984, and a result that to a significant\\ndegree, as I will explain in the next section, we brought upon ourselves.\\n</p>\\n<p>If no mega-catastrophe occurs, I \\xc2\\x96 once again \\xc2\\x96 expect the cost of our float to be low in the coming year.\\nWe will indeed need a low cost, as will all insurers.  Some years back, float costing, say, 4% was tolerable because\\ngovernment bonds yielded twice as much, and stocks prospectively offered still loftier returns.  Today, fat returns\\nare nowhere to be found (at least we can\\xc2\\x92t find them) and short-term funds earn less than 2%.  Under these\\nconditions, each of our insurance operations, save one, must deliver an underwriting profit if it is to be judged a\\ngood business.  The exception is our retroactive reinsurance operation (a business we explained in last year\\xc2\\x92s annual\\nreport), which has desirable economics even though it currently hits us with an annual underwriting loss of about\\n$425 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>Principles of Insurance Underwriting\\n</p>\\n<p>When property/casualty companies are judged by their cost of float, very few stack up as satisfactory\\nbusinesses.  And interestingly \\xc2\\x96 unlike the situation prevailing in many other industries \\xc2\\x96 neither size nor brand\\nname determines an insurer\\xc2\\x92s profitability.  Indeed, many of the biggest and best-known companies regularly\\ndeliver mediocre results.  What counts in this business is underwriting discipline.  The winners are those that\\nunfailingly stick to three key principles:\\n</p>\\n<p>1. They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate (staying within their circle of\\ncompetence) and that, after they have evaluated all relevant factors including remote loss\\nscenarios, carry the expectancy of profit.  These insurers ignore market-share considerations and\\nare sanguine about losing business to competitors that are offering foolish prices or policy\\nconditions.\\n</p>\\n<p>2. They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of\\nlosses from a single event or from related events that will threaten their solvency.  They\\nceaselessly search for possible correlation among seemingly-unrelated risks.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>8\\n</p>\\n<p>3. They avoid business involving moral risk: No matter what the rate, trying to write good contracts\\nwith bad people doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.  While most policyholders and clients are honorable and ethical,\\ndoing business with the few exceptions is usually expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so.\\n</p>\\n<p>The events of September 11th made it clear that our implementation of rules 1 and 2 at General Re had been\\ndangerously weak.  In setting prices and also in evaluating aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed\\nthe possibility of large-scale terrorism losses.  That was a relevant underwriting factor, and we ignored it.\\n</p>\\n<p>In pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past and taken into account only costs we\\nmight expect to incur from windstorm, fire, explosion and earthquake.  But what will be the largest insured property\\nloss in history (after adding related business-interruption claims) originated from none of these forces.  In short, all\\nof us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience, rather than exposure,\\nthereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no premium.\\n</p>\\n<p>Experience, of course, is a highly useful starting point in underwriting most coverages.  For example, it\\xc2\\x92s\\nimportant for insurers writing California earthquake policies to know how many quakes in the state during the past\\ncentury have registered 6.0 or greater on the Richter scale.  This information will not tell you the exact probability\\nof a big quake next year, or where in the state it might happen.  But the statistic has utility, particularly if you are\\nwriting a huge statewide policy, as National Indemnity has done in recent years.\\n</p>\\n<p>At certain times, however, using experience as a guide to pricing is not only useless, but actually\\ndangerous.  Late in a bull market, for example, large losses from directors and officers liability insurance (\\xc2\\x93D&amp;O\\xc2\\x94)\\nare likely to be relatively rare.  When stocks are rising, there are a scarcity of targets to sue, and both questionable\\naccounting and management chicanery often go undetected.  At that juncture, experience on high-limit D&amp;O may\\nlook great.\\n</p>\\n<p>But that\\xc2\\x92s just when exposure is likely to be exploding, by way of ridiculous public offerings, earnings\\nmanipulation, chain-letter-like stock promotions and a potpourri of other unsavory activities.  When stocks fall,\\nthese sins surface, hammering investors with losses that can run into the hundreds of billions.  Juries deciding\\nwhether those losses should be borne by small investors or big insurance companies can be expected to hit insurers\\nwith verdicts that bear little relation to those delivered in bull-market days.  Even one jumbo judgment, moreover,\\ncan cause settlement costs in later cases to mushroom.  Consequently, the correct rate for D&amp;O \\xc2\\x93excess\\xc2\\x94 (meaning\\nthe insurer or reinsurer will pay losses above a high threshold) might well, if based on exposure, be five or more\\ntimes the premium dictated by experience.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurers have always found it costly to ignore new exposures.  Doing that in the case of terrorism,\\nhowever, could literally bankrupt the industry.  No one knows the probability of a nuclear detonation in a major\\nmetropolis this year (or even multiple detonations, given that a terrorist organization able to construct one bomb\\nmight not stop there).  Nor can anyone, with assurance, assess the probability in this year, or another, of deadly\\nbiological or chemical agents being introduced simultaneously (say, through ventilation systems) into multiple\\noffice buildings and manufacturing plants.  An attack like that would produce astronomical workers\\xc2\\x92 compensation\\nclaims.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here\\xc2\\x92s what we do know:\\n</p>\\n<p>(a) The probability of such mind-boggling disasters, though likely very low at present, is not zero.\\n</p>\\n<p>(b) The probabilities are increasing, in an irregular and immeasurable manner, as knowledge and\\nmaterials become available to those who wish us ill.  Fear may recede with time, but the danger\\nwon\\xc2\\x92t \\xc2\\x96 the war against terrorism can never be won.  The best the nation can achieve is a long\\nsuccession of stalemates.  There can be no checkmate against hydra-headed foes.\\n</p>\\n<p>(c) Until now, insurers and reinsurers have blithely assumed the financial consequences from the\\nincalculable risks I have described.\\n</p>\\n<p>(d) Under a \\xc2\\x93close-to-worst-case\\xc2\\x94 scenario, which could conceivably involve $1 trillion of damage,\\nthe insurance industry would be destroyed unless it manages in some manner to dramatically limit\\nits assumption of terrorism risks.  Only the U.S. Government has the resources to absorb such a\\nblow.  If it is unwilling to do so on a prospective basis, the general citizenry must bear its own\\nrisks and count on the Government to come to its rescue after a disaster occurs.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>9\\n</p>\\n<p>Why, you might ask, didn\\xc2\\x92t I recognize the above facts before September 11th?  The answer, sadly, is that I\\ndid \\xc2\\x96 but I didn\\xc2\\x92t convert thought into action.  I violated the Noah rule: Predicting rain doesn\\xc2\\x92t count; building arks\\ndoes.  I consequently let Berkshire operate with a dangerous level of risk \\xc2\\x96 at General Re in particular.  I\\xc2\\x92m sorry to\\nsay that much risk for which we haven\\xc2\\x92t been compensated remains on our books, but it is running off by the day.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, it should be noted, we have for some years been willing to assume more risk than any other\\ninsurer has knowingly taken on.  That\\xc2\\x92s still the case.  We are perfectly willing to lose $2 billion to $2\\xc2\\xbd billion in a\\nsingle event (as we did on September 11th) if we have been paid properly for assuming the risk that caused the loss\\n(which on that occasion we weren\\xc2\\x92t).\\n</p>\\n<p>Indeed, we have a major competitive advantage because of our tolerance for huge losses.  Berkshire has\\nmassive liquid resources, substantial non-insurance earnings, a favorable tax position and a knowledgeable\\nshareholder constituency willing to accept volatility in earnings.  This unique combination enables us to assume\\nrisks that far exceed the appetite of even our largest competitors.  Over time, insuring these jumbo risks should be\\nprofitable, though periodically they will bring on a terrible year.\\n</p>\\n<p>The bottom-line today is that we will write some coverage for terrorist-related losses, including a few non-\\ncorrelated policies with very large limits.  But we will not knowingly expose Berkshire to losses beyond what we\\ncan comfortably handle.  We will control our total exposure, no matter what the competition does.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance Operations in 2001\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the years, our insurance business has provided ever-growing, low-cost funds that have fueled much\\nof Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s growth.  Charlie and I believe this will continue to be the case.  But we stumbled in a big way in\\n2001, largely because of underwriting losses at General Re.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the past I have assured you that General Re was underwriting with discipline \\xc2\\x96 and I have been proven\\nwrong.  Though its managers\\xc2\\x92 intentions were good, the company broke each of the three underwriting rules I set\\nforth in the last section and has paid a huge price for doing so.  One obvious cause for its failure is that it did not\\nreserve correctly \\xc2\\x96 more about this in the next section \\xc2\\x96 and therefore severely miscalculated the cost of the product\\nit was selling.  Not knowing your costs will cause problems in any business.  In long-tail reinsurance, where years\\nof unawareness will promote and prolong severe underpricing, ignorance of true costs is dynamite.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, General Re was overly-competitive in going after, and retaining, business.  While all\\nconcerned may intend to underwrite with care, it is nonetheless difficult for able, hard-driving professionals to curb\\ntheir urge to prevail over competitors.  If \\xc2\\x93winning,\\xc2\\x94 however, is equated with market share rather than profits,\\ntrouble awaits.  \\xc2\\x93No\\xc2\\x94 must be an important part of any underwriter\\xc2\\x92s vocabulary.\\n</p>\\n<p>At the risk of sounding Pollyannaish, I now assure you that underwriting discipline is being restored at\\nGeneral Re (and its Cologne Re subsidiary) with appropriate urgency.  Joe Brandon was appointed General Re\\xc2\\x92s\\nCEO in September and, along with Tad Montross, its new president, is committed to producing underwriting\\nprofits.  Last fall, Charlie and I read Jack Welch\\xc2\\x92s terrific book, Jack, Straight from the Gut (get a copy!).  In\\ndiscussing it, we agreed that Joe has many of Jack\\xc2\\x92s characteristics: He is smart, energetic, hands-on, and expects\\nmuch of both himself and his organization.\\n</p>\\n<p>When it was an independent company, General Re often shone, and now it also has the considerable\\nstrengths Berkshire brings to the table.  With that added advantage and with underwriting discipline restored,\\nGeneral Re should be a huge asset for Berkshire.  I predict that Joe and Tad will make it so.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nAt the National Indemnity reinsurance operation, Ajit Jain continues to add enormous value to Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Working with only 18 associates, Ajit manages one of the world\\xc2\\x92s largest reinsurance operations measured by\\nassets, and the largest, based upon the size of individual risks assumed.\\n</p>\\n<p>I have known the details of almost every policy that Ajit has written since he came with us in 1986, and\\nnever on even a single occasion have I seen him break any of our three underwriting rules.  His extraordinary\\ndiscipline, of course, does not eliminate losses; it does, however, prevent foolish losses.  And that\\xc2\\x92s the key: Just as\\nis the case in investing, insurers produce outstanding long-term results primarily by avoiding dumb decisions, rather\\nthan by making brilliant ones.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>10\\n</p>\\n<p>Since September 11th, Ajit has been particularly busy.

We have written many other jumbo risks as well, such as protection for the World Cup Soccer\\nTournament and the 2002 Winter Olympics.  In all cases, however, we have attempted to avoid writing groups of\\npolicies from which losses might seriously aggregate.

When a daisy chain of retrocessionaires exists, a single weak link can pose trouble for\\nall.  In assessing the soundness of their reinsurance protection, insurers must therefore apply a stress test to all\\nparticipants in the chain, and must contemplate a catastrophe loss occurring during a very unfavorable economic\\nenvironment.

Quite simply, Tony is an owner\\xc2\\x92s dream.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xc2\\x92s premium volume grew 6.6% last year, its float grew $308 million, and it achieved an\\nunderwriting profit of $221 million.

       "  '10': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>11\\n</p>\\n<p>In insurance reporting, \\xc2\\x93loss development\\xc2\\x94 is a widely used term \\xc2\\x96 and one that is seriously misleading.\\nFirst, a definition: Loss reserves at an insurer are not funds tucked away for a rainy day, but rather a liability\\naccount.  If properly calculated, the liability states the amount that an insurer will have to pay for all losses\\n(including associated costs) that have occurred prior to the reporting date but have not yet been paid.  When\\ncalculating the reserve, the insurer will have been notified of many of the losses it is destined to pay, but others will\\nnot yet have been reported to it.  These losses are called IBNR, for incurred but not reported.  Indeed, in some cases\\n(involving, say, product liability or embezzlement) the insured itself will not yet be aware that a loss has occurred.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xc2\\x92s clearly difficult for an insurer to put a figure on the ultimate cost of all such reported and unreported\\nevents.  But the ability to do so with reasonable accuracy is vital.  Otherwise the insurer\\xc2\\x92s managers won\\xc2\\x92t know\\nwhat its actual loss costs are and how these compare to the premiums being charged.  GEICO got into huge trouble\\nin the early 1970s because for several years it severely underreserved, and therefore believed its product (insurance\\nprotection) was costing considerably less than was truly the case.  Consequently, the company sailed blissfully\\nalong, underpricing its product and selling more and more policies at ever-larger losses.\\n</p>\\n<p>When it becomes evident that reserves at past reporting dates understated the liability that truly existed at\\nthe time, companies speak of \\xc2\\x93loss development.\\xc2\\x94  In the year discovered, these shortfalls penalize reported\\nearnings because the \\xc2\\x93catch-up\\xc2\\x94 costs from prior years must be added to current-year costs when results are\\ncalculated.  This is what happened at General Re in 2001: a staggering $800 million of loss costs that actually\\noccurred in earlier years, but that were not then recorded, were belatedly recognized last year and charged against\\ncurrent earnings.  The mistake was an honest one, I can assure you of that.  Nevertheless, for several years, this\\nunderreserving caused us to believe that our costs were much lower than they truly were, an error that contributed to\\nwoefully inadequate pricing.  Additionally, the overstated profit figures led us to pay substantial incentive\\ncompensation that we should not have and to incur income taxes far earlier than was necessary.\\n</p>\\n<p>We recommend scrapping the term \\xc2\\x93loss development\\xc2\\x94 and its equally ugly twin, \\xc2\\x93reserve strengthening.\\xc2\\x94\\n(Can you imagine an insurer, upon finding its reserves excessive, describing the reduction that follows as \\xc2\\x93reserve\\nweakening\\xc2\\x94?)  \\xc2\\x93Loss development\\xc2\\x94 suggests to investors that some natural, uncontrollable event has occurred in the\\ncurrent year, and \\xc2\\x93reserve strengthening\\xc2\\x94 implies that adequate amounts have been further buttressed.  The truth,\\nhowever, is that management made an error in estimation that in turn produced an error in the earnings previously\\nreported.  The losses didn\\xc2\\x92t \\xc2\\x93develop\\xc2\\x94 \\xc2\\x96 they were there all along.  What developed was management\\xc2\\x92s\\nunderstanding of the losses (or, in the instances of chicanery, management\\xc2\\x92s willingness to finally fess up).\\n</p>\\n<p>A more forthright label for the phenomenon at issue would be \\xc2\\x93loss costs we failed to recognize when they\\noccurred\\xc2\\x94 (or maybe just \\xc2\\x93oops\\xc2\\x94).  Underreserving, it should be noted, is a common \\xc2\\x96 and serious \\xc2\\x96 problem\\nthroughout the property/casualty insurance industry.  At Berkshire we told you of our own problems with\\nunderestimation in 1984 and 1986.  Generally, however, our reserving has been conservative.\\n</p>\\n<p>Major underreserving is common in cases of companies struggling for survival.  In effect, insurance\\naccounting is a self-graded exam, in that the insurer gives some figures to its auditing firm and generally doesn\\xc2\\x92t get\\nan argument.  (What the auditor gets, however, is a letter from management that is designed to take his firm off the\\nhook if the numbers later look silly.)  A company experiencing financial difficulties \\xc2\\x96 of a kind that, if truly faced,\\ncould put it out of business \\xc2\\x96 seldom proves to be a tough grader.  Who, after all, wants to prepare his own\\nexecution papers?\\n</p>\\n<p>Even when companies have the best of intentions, it\\xc2\\x92s not easy to reserve properly.  I\\xc2\\x92ve told the story in\\nthe past about the fellow traveling abroad whose sister called to tell him that their dad had died.  The brother replied\\nthat it was impossible for him to get home for the funeral; he volunteered, however, to shoulder its cost.  Upon\\nreturning, the brother received a bill from the mortuary for $4,500, which he promptly paid.  A month later, and a\\nmonth after that also, he paid $10 pursuant to an add-on invoice.  When a third $10 invoice came, he called his\\nsister for an explanation.  \\xc2\\x93Oh,\\xc2\\x94 she replied, \\xc2\\x93I forgot to tell you.  We buried dad in a rented suit.\\xc2\\x94\\n</p>\\n<p>There are a lot of \\xc2\\x93rented suits\\xc2\\x94 buried in the past operations of insurance companies.  Sometimes the\\nproblems they signify lie dormant for decades, as was the case with asbestos liability, before virulently manifesting\\nthemselves.  Difficult as the job may be, it\\xc2\\x92s management\\xc2\\x92s responsibility to adequately account for all possibilities.\\nConservatism is essential.  When a claims manager walks into the CEO\\xc2\\x92s office and says \\xc2\\x93Guess what just\\nhappened,\\xc2\\x94 his boss, if a veteran, does not expect to hear it\\xc2\\x92s good news.  Surprises in the insurance world have\\nbeen far from symmetrical in their effect on earnings.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>12\\n</p>\\n<p>Because of this one-sided experience, it is folly to suggest, as some are doing, that all property/casualty\\ninsurance reserves be discounted, an approach reflecting the fact that they will be paid in the future and that\\ntherefore their present value is less than the stated liability for them.  Discounting might be acceptable if reserves\\ncould be precisely established.  They can\\xc2\\x92t, however, because a myriad of forces \\xc2\\x96 judicial broadening of policy\\nlanguage and medical inflation, to name just two chronic problems \\xc2\\x96 are constantly working to make reserves\\ninadequate.  Discounting would exacerbate this already-serious situation and, additionally, would provide a new\\ntool for the companies that are inclined to fudge.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xc2\\x92d say that the effects from telling a profit-challenged insurance CEO to lower reserves through\\ndiscounting would be comparable to those that would ensue if a father told his 16-year-old son to have a normal sex\\nlife.

Brown\\nand Justin swamped by losses at Dexter.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xc2\\x92ve made three decisions relating to Dexter that have hurt you in a major way:  (1) buying it in the first place;\\n(2) paying for it with stock and (3) procrastinating when the need for changes in its operations was obvious.  I\\nwould like to lay these mistakes on Charlie (or anyone else, for that matter) but they were mine.  Dexter, prior\\nto our purchase \\xc2\\x96 and indeed for a few years after \\xc2\\x96 prospered despite low-cost foreign competition that was\\nbrutal.  I concluded that Dexter could continue to cope with that problem, and I was wrong.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have now placed the Dexter operation \\xc2\\x96 which is still substantial in size \\xc2\\x96 under the management of Frank\\nRooney and Jim Issler at H.H. Brown.  These men have performed outstandingly for Berkshire, skillfully\\ncontending with the extraordinary changes that have bedeviled the footwear industry.  During part of 2002,\\nDexter will be hurt by unprofitable sales commitments it made last year.  After that, we believe our shoe\\nbusiness will be reasonably profitable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 MidAmerican Energy, of which we own 76% on a fully-diluted basis, had a good year in 2001.  Its reported\\nearnings should also increase considerably in 2002 given that the company has been shouldering a large\\ncharge for the amortization of goodwill and that this \\xc2\\x93cost\\xc2\\x94 will disappear under the new GAAP rules.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year MidAmerican swapped some properties in England, adding Yorkshire Electric, with its 2.1 million\\ncustomers.  We are now serving 3.6 million customers in the U.K. and are its 2nd largest electric utility.  We\\nhave an equally important operation in Iowa as well as major generating facilities in California and the\\nPhilippines.\\n</p>\\n<p>At MidAmerican \\xc2\\x96 this may surprise you \\xc2\\x96 we also own the second-largest residential real estate brokerage\\nbusiness in the country.  We are market-share leaders in a number of large cities, primarily in the Midwest, and\\nhave recently acquired important firms in Atlanta and Southern California.  Last year, operating under various\\nnames that are locally familiar, we handled about 106,000 transactions involving properties worth nearly $20\\nbillion.  Ron Peltier has built this business for us, and it\\xc2\\x92s likely he will make more acquisitions in 2002 and\\nthe years to come.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Considering the recessionary environment plaguing them, our retailing operations did well in 2001.  In\\njewelry, same-store sales fell 7.6% and pre-tax margins were 8.9% versus 10.7% in 2000.  Return on invested\\ncapital remains high.\\n</p>\\n<p>Same-store sales at our home-furnishings retailers were unchanged and so was the margin \\xc2\\x96 9.1% pre-tax \\xc2\\x96\\nthese operations earned.  Here, too, return on invested capital is excellent.\\n</p>\\n<p>We continue to expand in both jewelry and home-furnishings.  Of particular note, Nebraska Furniture Mart is\\nconstructing a mammoth 450,000 square foot store that will serve the greater Kansas City area beginning in\\nthe fall of 2003.  Despite Bill Child\\xc2\\x92s counter-successes, we will keep this store open on Sundays.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The large acquisitions we initiated in late 2000 \\xc2\\x96 Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore \\xc2\\x96 all came\\nthrough their first year with us in great fashion.  Charlie and I knew at the time of our purchases that we were\\nin good hands with Bob Shaw, Jerry Henry and Yvan Dupuy, respectively \\xc2\\x96 and we admire their work even\\nmore now.  Together these businesses earned about $659 million pre-tax.\\n</p>\\n<p>Shortly after yearend we exchanged 4,740 Berkshire A shares (or their equivalent in B shares) for the 12.7%\\nminority interest in Shaw, which means we now own 100% of the company.  Shaw is our largest non-\\ninsurance operation and will play a big part in Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s future.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 All of the income shown for Flight Services in 2001 \\xc2\\x96 and a bit more \\xc2\\x96 came from FlightSafety, our pilot-\\ntraining subsidiary.  Its earnings increased 2.5%, though return on invested capital fell slightly because of the\\n$258 million investment we made last year in simulators and other fixed assets.  My 84-year-old friend, Al\\nUeltschi, continues to run FlightSafety with the same enthusiasm and competitive spirit that he has exhibited\\nsince 1951, when he invested $10,000 to start the company.  If I line Al up with a bunch of 60-year-olds at the\\nannual meeting, you will not be able to pick him out.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

However, training\\nfor business and general aviation, our main activity, is at near-normal levels and should continue to grow.  In\\n2002, we expect to spend $162 million for 27 simulators, a sum far in excess of our annual depreciation charge\\nof $95 million.  Those who believe that EBITDA is in any way equivalent to true earnings are welcome to pick\\nup the tab.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our NetJets\\xc2\\xae fractional ownership program sold a record number of planes last year and also showed a gain of\\n21.9% in service income from management fees and hourly charges.  Nevertheless, it operated at a small loss,\\nversus a small profit in 2000.  We made a little money in the U.S., but these earnings were more than offset by\\nEuropean losses.

In case you\\xc2\\x92re wondering, we use exactly the same planes and crews that serve NetJet\\xc2\\x92s other\\ncustomers.\\n</p>\\n<p>NetJets experienced a spurt in new orders shortly after September 11th, but its sales pace has since returned to\\nnormal.  Per-customer usage declined somewhat during the year, probably because of the recession.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both we and our customers derive significant operational benefits from our being the runaway leader in the\\nfractional ownership business.  We have more than 300 planes constantly on the go in the U.S. and can\\ntherefore be wherever a customer needs us on very short notice.  The ubiquity of our fleet also reduces our\\n\\xc2\\x93positioning\\xc2\\x94 costs below those incurred by operators with smaller fleets.\\n</p>\\n<p>These advantages of scale, and others we have, give NetJets a significant economic edge over competition.\\nUnder the competitive conditions likely to prevail for a few years, however, our advantage will at best produce\\nmodest profits.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Our finance and financial products line of business now includes XTRA, General Re Securities (which is in a\\nrun-off mode that will continue for an extended period) and a few other relatively small operations.

As a group, our larger holdings have performed\\npoorly in the last few years, some because of disappointing operating results.  Charlie and I still like the basic\\nbusinesses of all the companies we own.  But we do not believe Berkshire\\xc2\\x92s equity holdings as a group are\\nundervalued.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our restrained enthusiasm for these securities is matched by decidedly lukewarm feelings about the\\nprospects for stocks in general over the next decade or so.  I expressed my views about equity returns in a speech I\\ngave at an Allen and Company meeting in July (which was a follow-up to a similar presentation I had made two\\nyears earlier) and an edited version of my comments appeared in a December 10th Fortune article.  I\\xc2\\x92m enclosing a\\ncopy of that article.  You can also view the Fortune version of my 1999 talk at our website\\nwww.berkshirehathaway.com.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe that American business will do fine over time but think that today\\xc2\\x92s equity prices\\npresage only moderate returns for investors.  The market outperformed business for a very long period, and that\\nphenomenon had to end.  A market that no more than parallels business progress, however, is likely to leave many\\ninvestors disappointed, particularly those relatively new to the game.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here\\xc2\\x92s one for those who enjoy an odd coincidence: The Great Bubble ended on March 10, 2000 (though\\nwe didn\\xc2\\x92t realize that fact until some months later).  On that day, the NASDAQ (recently 1,731) hit its all-time high\\nof 5,132.  That same day, Berkshire shares traded at $40,800, their lowest price since mid-1997.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>During 2001, we were somewhat more active than usual in \\xc2\\x93junk\\xc2\\x94 bonds.  These are not, we should\\nemphasize, suitable investments for the general public, because too often these securities live up to their name.  We\\nhave never purchased a newly-issued junk bond, which is the only kind most investors are urged to buy.  When\\nlosses occur in this field, furthermore, they are often disastrous: Many issues end up at a small fraction of their\\noriginal offering price and some become entirely worthless.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite these dangers, we periodically find a few \\xc2\\x96 a very few \\xc2\\x96 junk securities that are interesting to us.\\nAnd, so far, our 50-year experience in distressed debt has proven rewarding.  In our 1984 annual report, we\\ndescribed our purchases of Washington Public Power System bonds when that issuer fell into disrepute.  We\\xc2\\x92ve\\nalso, over the years, stepped into other apparent calamities such as Chrysler Financial, Texaco and RJR Nabisco \\xc2\\x96\\nall of which returned to grace.  Still, if we stay active in junk bonds, you can expect us to have losses from time to\\ntime.\\n</p>\\n<p>Occasionally, a purchase of distressed bonds leads us into something bigger.  Early in the Fruit of the\\nLoom bankruptcy, we purchased the company\\xc2\\x92s public and bank debt at about 50% of face value.  This was an\\nunusual bankruptcy in that interest payments on senior debt were continued without interruption, which meant we\\nearned about a 15% current return.  Our holdings grew to 10% of Fruit\\xc2\\x92s senior debt, which will probably end up\\nreturning us about 70% of face value.  Through this investment, we indirectly reduced our purchase price for the\\nwhole company by a small amount.\\n</p>\\n<p>In late 2000, we began purchasing the obligations of FINOVA Group, a troubled finance company, and\\nthat, too, led to our making a major transaction.  FINOVA then had about $11 billion of debt outstanding, of which\\nwe purchased 13% at about two-thirds of face value.  We expected the company to go into bankruptcy, but believed\\nthat liquidation of its assets would produce a payoff for creditors that would be well above our cost.  As default\\nloomed in early 2001, we joined forces with Leucadia National Corporation to present the company with a\\nprepackaged plan for bankruptcy.\\n</p>\\n<p>The plan as subsequently modified (and I\\xc2\\x92m simplifying here) provided that creditors would be paid 70%\\nof face value (along with full interest) and that they would receive a newly-issued 7\\xc2\\xbd% note for the 30% of their\\nclaims not satisfied by cash.  To fund FINOVA\\xc2\\x92s 70% distribution, Leucadia and Berkshire formed a jointly-owned\\nentity \\xc2\\x96 mellifluently christened Berkadia \\xc2\\x96 that borrowed $5.6 billion through FleetBoston and, in turn, re-lent this\\nsum to FINOVA, concurrently obtaining a priority claim on its assets.  Berkshire guaranteed 90% of the Berkadia\\nborrowing and also has a secondary guarantee on the 10% for which Leucadia has primary responsibility.  (Did I\\nmention that I am simplifying?).</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<div class=\"annotation\"><a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/\">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/</a></div>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>16\\n</p>\\n<p>There is a spread of about two percentage points between what Berkadia pays on its borrowing and what it\\nreceives from FINOVA, with this spread flowing 90% to Berkshire and 10% to Leucadia.  As I write this, each loan\\nhas been paid down to $3.9 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>As part of the bankruptcy plan, which was approved on August 10, 2001, Berkshire also agreed to offer\\n70% of face value for up to $500 million principal amount of the $3.25 billion of new 7\\xc2\\xbd% bonds that were issued\\nby FINOVA.  (Of these, we had already received $426.8 million in principal amount because of our 13% ownership\\nof the original debt.)  Our offer, which was to run until September 26, 2001, could be withdrawn under a variety of\\nconditions, one of which became operative if the New York Stock Exchange closed during the offering period.\\nWhen that indeed occurred in the week of September 11th, we promptly terminated the offer.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many of FINOVA\\xc2\\x92s loans involve aircraft assets whose values were significantly diminished by the events\\nof September 11th.  Other receivables held by the company also were imperiled by the economic consequences of\\nthe attack that day.  FINOVA\\xc2\\x92s prospects, therefore, are not as good as when we made our proposal to the\\nbankruptcy court.  Nevertheless we feel that overall the transaction will prove satisfactory for Berkshire.  Leucadia\\nhas day-to-day operating responsibility for FINOVA, and we have long been impressed with the business acumen\\nand managerial talent of its key executives.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xc2\\x92s d\\xc3\\xa9j\\xc3\\xa0 vu time again: In early 1965, when the investment partnership I ran took control of Berkshire, that\\ncompany had its main banking relationships with First National Bank of Boston and a large New York City bank.\\nPreviously, I had done no business with either.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fast forward to 1969, when I wanted Berkshire to buy the Illinois National Bank and Trust of Rockford.\\nWe needed $10 million, and I contacted both banks.  There was no response from New York.  However, two\\nrepresentatives of the Boston bank immediately came to Omaha.  They told me they would supply the money for\\nour purchase and that we would work out the details later.\\n</p>\\n<p>For the next three decades, we borrowed almost nothing from banks.  (Debt is a four-letter word around\\nBerkshire.)  Then, in February, when we were structuring the FINOVA transaction, I again called Boston, where\\nFirst National had morphed into FleetBoston.  Chad Gifford, the company\\xc2\\x92s president, responded just as Bill Brown\\nand Ira Stepanian had back in 1969 \\xc2\\x96 \\xc2\\x93you\\xc2\\x92ve got the money and we\\xc2\\x92ll work out the details later.\\xc2\\x94\\n</p>\\n<p>And that\\xc2\\x92s just what happened.  FleetBoston syndicated a loan for $6 billion (as it turned out, we didn\\xc2\\x92t\\nneed $400 million of it), and it was quickly oversubscribed by 17 banks throughout the world.  Sooooo . . . if you\\never need $6 billion, just give Chad a call \\xc2\\x96 assuming, that is, your credit is AAA.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>One more point about our investments: The media often report that \\xc2\\x93Buffett is buying\\xc2\\x94 this or that security,\\nhaving picked up the \\xc2\\x93fact\\xc2\\x94 from reports that Berkshire files.  These accounts are sometimes correct, but at other\\ntimes the transactions Berkshire reports are actually being made by Lou Simpson, who runs a $2 billion portfolio for\\nGEICO that is quite independent of me.  Normally, Lou does not tell me what he is buying or selling, and I learn of\\nhis activities only when I look at a GEICO portfolio summary that I receive a few days after the end of each month.\\nLou\\xc2\\x92s thinking, of course, is quite similar to mine, but we usually end up in different securities.  That\\xc2\\x92s largely\\nbecause he\\xc2\\x92s working with less money and can therefore invest in smaller companies than I.  Oh, yes, there\\xc2\\x92s also\\nanother minor difference between us: In recent years, Lou\\xc2\\x92s performance has been far better than mine.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>17\\n</p>\\n<p>Charitable Contributions\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire follows a highly unusual policy in respect to charitable contributions \\xc2\\x96 but it\\xc2\\x92s one that Charlie\\nand I believe is both rational and fair to owners.\\n</p>\\n<p>First, we let our operating subsidiaries make their own charitable decisions, requesting only that the\\nowners/managers who once ran these as independent companies make all donations to their personal charities from\\ntheir own funds, instead of using company money.  When our managers are using company funds, we trust them to\\nmake gifts in a manner that delivers commensurate tangible or intangible benefits to the operations they manage.\\nLast year contributions from Berkshire subsidiaries totaled $19.2 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>At the parent company level, we make no contributions except those designated by shareholders.  We do\\nnot match contributions made by directors or employees, nor do we give to the favorite charities of the Buffetts or\\nthe Mungers.  However, prior to our purchasing them, a few of our subsidiaries had employee-match programs and\\nwe feel fine about their continuing them: It\\xc2\\x92s not our style to tamper with successful business cultures.\\n</p>\\n<p>To implement our owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 charitable desires, each year we notify registered holders of A shares (A\\xc2\\x92s\\nrepresent 86.6% of our equity capital) of a per-share amount that they can instruct us to contribute to as many as\\nthree charities.  Shareholders name the charity; Berkshire writes the check.  Any organization that qualifies under\\nthe Internal Revenue Code can be designated by shareholders.  Last year Berkshire made contributions of $16.7\\nmillion at the direction of 5,700 shareholders, who named 3,550 charities as recipients.  Since we started this\\nprogram, our shareholders\\xc2\\x92 gifts have totaled $181 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>Most public corporations eschew gifts to religious institutions.  These, however, are favorite charities of\\nour shareholders, who last year named 437 churches and synagogues to receive gifts.  Additionally, 790 schools\\nwere recipients.  A few of our larger shareholders, including Charlie and me, designate their personal foundations to\\nget gifts, so that those entities can, in turn, disburse their funds widely.\\n</p>\\n<p>I get a few letters every week criticizing Berkshire for contributing to Planned Parenthood.  These letters\\nare usually prompted by an organization that wishes to see boycotts of Berkshire products.  The letters are\\ninvariably polite and sincere, but their writers are unaware of a key point: It\\xc2\\x92s not Berkshire, but rather its owners\\nwho are making charitable decisions \\xc2\\x96 and these owners are about as diverse in their opinions as you can imagine.\\nFor example, they are probably on both sides of the abortion issue in roughly the same proportion as the American\\npopulation.  We\\xc2\\x92ll follow their instructions, whether they designate Planned Parenthood or Metro Right to Life, just\\nas long as the charity possesses 501(c)(3) status.  It\\xc2\\x92s as if we paid a dividend, which the shareholder then donated.\\nOur form of disbursement, however, is more tax-efficient.\\n</p>\\n<p>In neither the purchase of goods nor the hiring of personnel, do we ever consider the religious views, the\\ngender, the race or the sexual orientation of the persons we are dealing with.  It would not only be wrong to do so, it\\nwould be idiotic.  We need all of the talent we can find, and we have learned that able and trustworthy managers,\\nemployees and suppliers come from a very wide spectrum of humanity.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>To participate in our future charitable contribution programs, you must own Class A shares that are\\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so\\nregistered on August 31, 2002 will be ineligible for the 2002 program.  When you get the contributions form from\\nus, return it promptly.

Over the last 38 years (that is, since present management\\ntook over) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $41,727, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.\\xe2\\x88\\x97\\n</p>\\n<p>In all respects 2002 was a banner year.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll provide details later, but here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a summary:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Our various non-insurance operations performed exceptionally well, despite a sluggish economy.\\nA decade ago Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual pre-tax earnings from our non-insurance businesses was $272\\nmillion. Now, from our ever-expanding collection of manufacturing, retailing, service and finance\\nbusinesses, we earn that sum monthly.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Our insurance group increased its float to $41.2 billion, a hefty gain of $5.7 billion.  Better yet, the\\nuse of these funds in 2002 cost us only 1%.  Getting back to low-cost float feels good, particularly\\nafter our poor results during the three previous years.  Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division and\\nGEICO shot the lights out in 2002, and underwriting discipline was restored at General Re.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Berkshire acquired some important new businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with economic characteristics ranging from\\ngood to great, run by managers ranging from great to great.  Those attributes are two legs of our\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9centrance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d strategy, the third being a sensible purchase price.  Unlike LBO operators and private\\nequity firms, we have no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d strategy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we buy to keep.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one reason why Berkshire is\\nusually the first \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and sometimes the only \\xe2\\x80\\x93 choice for sellers and their managers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Our marketable securities outperformed most indices.  For Lou Simpson, who manages equities at\\nGEICO, this was old stuff.  But, for me, it was a welcome change from the last few years, during\\nwhich my investment record was dismal.\\n</p>\\n<p>The confluence of these favorable factors in 2002 caused our book-value gain to outstrip the\\nperformance of the S&amp;P 500 by 32.1 percentage points.  This result is aberrational: Charlie Munger,\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice chairman and my partner, and I hope to achieve \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an average annual advantage\\nof a few points.  In the future, there will be years in which the S&amp;P soundly trounces us.  That will in fact\\nalmost certainly happen during a strong bull market, because the portion of our assets committed to\\ncommon stocks has significantly declined.  This change, of course, helps our relative performance in down\\nmarkets such as we had in 2002.\\n</p>\\n<p>I have another caveat to mention about last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results.

In these\\npresentations, the CEO tells his owners \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count this, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just count what makes earnings\\nfat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Often, a forget-all-this-bad-stuff message is delivered year after year without management so much as\\nblushing.\\n</p>\\n<p>                                                          \\n\\xe2\\x88\\x97 All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares, the successor to the only stock that\\n</p>\\n<p>the company had outstanding before 1996.

First, in 2002 there was no\\nmegacatastrophe, which means that Berkshire (and other insurers as well) earned more from insurance than\\nif losses had been normal.  In years when the reverse is true \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because of a blockbuster hurricane,\\nearthquake or man-made disaster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many insurers like to report that they would have earned X \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexcept for\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthe unusual event.  The implication is that since such megacats are infrequent, they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be counted\\nwhen \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d earnings are calculated.  That is deceptive nonsense.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcept for\\xe2\\x80\\x9d losses will forever be part\\nof the insurance business, and they will forever be paid with shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 money.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nonetheless, for the purposes of this exercise, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take a page from the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book.  For last\\nyear, when we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any truly major disasters, a downward adjustment is appropriate if you wish to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormalize\\xe2\\x80\\x9d our underwriting result.\\n</p>\\n<p>Secondly, the bond market in 2002 favored certain strategies we employed in our finance and\\nfinancial products business.  Gains from those strategies will certainly diminish within a year or two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\nmay well disappear.\\n</p>\\n<p>Soooo . . . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexcept for\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a couple of favorable breaks, our pre-tax earnings last year would have\\nbeen about $500 million less than we actually reported.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re happy, nevertheless, to bank the excess.  As\\nJack Benny once said upon receiving an award: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deserve this honor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but, then, I have arthritis, and\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deserve that either.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We continue to be blessed with an extraordinary group of managers, many of whom haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the\\nslightest financial need to work.  They stick around, though: In 38 years, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had a single CEO of\\na subsidiary elect to leave Berkshire to work elsewhere.  Counting Charlie, we now have six managers over\\n75, and I hope that in four years that number increases by at least two (Bob Shaw and I are both 72).  Our\\nrationale: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating CEOs are masters of their crafts and run their businesses as if they were\\ntheir own.  My job is to stay out of their way and allocate whatever excess capital their businesses generate.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy work.\\n</p>\\n<p>My managerial model is Eddie Bennett, who was a batboy.  In 1919, at age 19, Eddie began his\\nwork with the Chicago White Sox, who that year went to the World Series.  The next year, Eddie switched\\nto the Brooklyn Dodgers, and they, too, won their league title.  Our hero, however, smelled trouble.\\nChanging boroughs, he joined the Yankees in 1921, and they promptly won their first pennant in history.\\nNow Eddie settled in, shrewdly seeing what was coming.  In the next seven years, the Yankees won five\\nAmerican League titles.\\n</p>\\n<p>What does this have to do with management?  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be a winner, work with winners.  In\\n1927, for example, Eddie received $700 for the 1/8th World Series share voted him by the legendary\\nYankee team of Ruth and Gehrig.  This sum, which Eddie earned by working only four days (because New\\nYork swept the Series) was roughly equal to the full-year pay then earned by batboys who worked with\\nordinary associates.\\n</p>\\n<p>Eddie understood that how he lugged bats was unimportant; what counted instead was hooking up\\nwith the cream of those on the playing field.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned from Eddie.  At Berkshire, I regularly hand bats\\nto many of the heaviest hitters in American business.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisitions\\n</p>\\n<p>We added some sluggers to our lineup last year.  Two acquisitions pending at yearend 2001 were\\ncompleted: Albecca (which operates under the name Larson-Juhl), the U.S. leader in custom-made picture\\nframes; and Fruit of the Loom, the producer of about 33.3% of the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwear sold in the\\nU.S. and of other apparel as well.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>5\\n</p>\\n<p>Both companies came with outstanding CEOs: Steve McKenzie at Albecca and John Holland at\\nFruit.  John, who had retired from Fruit in 1996, rejoined it three years ago and rescued the company from\\nthe disastrous path it had gone down after he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d left.  He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now 70, and I am trying to convince him to make\\nhis next retirement coincident with mine (presently scheduled for five years after my death \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a date subject,\\nhowever, to extension).\\n</p>\\n<p>We initiated and completed two other acquisitions last year that were somewhat below our normal\\nsize threshold.  In aggregate, however, these businesses earn more than $60 million pre-tax annually.  Both\\noperate in industries characterized by tough economics, but both also have important competitive strengths\\nthat enable them to earn decent returns on capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>The newcomers are:\\n</p>\\n<p>(a) CTB, a worldwide leader in equipment for the poultry, hog, egg production and grain\\nindustries; and\\n</p>\\n<p>(b) Garan, a manufacturer of children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apparel, whose largest and best-known line is\\nGaranimals\\xc2\\xae.\\n</p>\\n<p>These two companies came with the managers responsible for their impressive records: Vic\\nMancinelli at CTB and Seymour Lichtenstein at Garan.\\n</p>\\n<p>The largest acquisition we initiated in 2002 was The Pampered Chef, a company with a fascinating\\nhistory dating back to 1980.  Doris Christopher was then a 34-year-old suburban Chicago home economics\\nteacher with a husband, two little girls, and absolutely no business background.  Wanting, however, to\\nsupplement her family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s modest income, she turned to thinking about what she knew best \\xe2\\x80\\x93 food\\npreparation.  Why not, she wondered, make a business out of marketing kitchenware, focusing on the items\\nshe herself had found most useful?\\n</p>\\n<p>To get started, Doris borrowed $3,000 against her life insurance policy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the money ever\\ninjected into the company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and went to the Merchandise Mart on a buying expedition.  There, she picked\\nup a dozen each of this and that, and then went home to set up operations in her basement.\\n</p>\\n<p>Her plan was to conduct in-home presentations to small groups of women, gathered at the homes\\nof their friends.  While driving to her first presentation, though, Doris almost talked herself into returning\\nhome, convinced she was doomed to fail.\\n</p>\\n<p>But the women she faced that evening loved her and her products, purchased $175 of goods, and\\nTPC was underway.  Working with her husband, Jay, Doris did $50,000 of business in the first year.\\nToday \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only 22 years later \\xe2\\x80\\x93 TPC does more than $700 million of business annually, working through\\n67,000 kitchen consultants.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been to a TPC party, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see why the business is a success.  The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nproducts, in large part proprietary, are well-styled and highly useful, and the consultants are knowledgeable\\nand enthusiastic.  Everyone has a good time.  Hurry to pamperedchef.com on the Internet to find where to\\nattend a party near you.\\n</p>\\n<p>Two years ago, Doris brought in Sheila O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connell Cooper, now CEO, to share the management\\nload, and in August they met with me in Omaha.  It took me about ten seconds to decide that these were\\ntwo managers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made a deal.  Berkshire shareholders\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be luckier than to be associated with Doris and Sheila.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire also made some important acquisitions last year through MidAmerican Energy Holdings\\n(MEHC), a company in which our equity interest is 80.2%.  Because the Public Utility Holding Company\\nAct (PUHCA) limits us to 9.9% voting control, however, we are unable to fully consolidate MEHC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfinancial statements.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite the voting-control limitation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the somewhat strange capital structure at MEHC it has\\nengendered \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the company is a key part of Berkshire.

       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>6\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year MEHC acquired two important gas pipelines.  The first, Kern River, extends from\\nSouthwest Wyoming to Southern California.  This line moves about 900 million cubic feet of gas a day and\\nis undergoing a $1.2 billion expansion that will double throughput by this fall.  At that point, the line will\\ncarry enough gas to generate electricity for ten million homes.\\n</p>\\n<p>The second acquisition, Northern Natural Gas, is a 16,600 mile line extending from the Southwest\\nto a wide range of Midwestern locations.  This purchase completes a corporate odyssey of particular\\ninterest to Omahans.\\n</p>\\n<p>From its beginnings in the 1930s, Northern Natural was one of Omaha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier businesses, run\\nby CEOs who regularly distinguished themselves as community leaders.  Then, in July, 1985, the company\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 which in 1980 had been renamed InterNorth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 merged with Houston Natural Gas, a business less than\\nhalf its size.  The companies announced that the enlarged operation would be headquartered in Omaha,\\nwith InterNorth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO continuing in that job.\\n</p>\\n<p>Within a year, those promises were broken.  By then, the former CEO of Houston Natural had\\ntaken over the top job at InterNorth, the company had been renamed, and the headquarters had been moved\\nto Houston.  These switches were orchestrated by the new CEO \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ken Lay \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the name he chose was\\nEnron.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fast forward 15 years to late 2001.  Enron ran into the troubles we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard so much about and\\nborrowed money from Dynegy, putting up the Northern Natural pipeline operation as collateral.  The two\\ncompanies quickly had a falling out, and the pipeline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership moved to Dynegy.  That company, in\\nturn, soon encountered severe financial problems of its own.\\n</p>\\n<p>MEHC received a call on Friday, July 26, from Dynegy, which was looking for a quick and\\ncertain cash sale of the pipeline.  Dynegy phoned the right party: On July 29, we signed a contract, and\\nshortly thereafter Northern Natural returned home.\\n</p>\\n<p>When 2001 began, Charlie and I had no idea that Berkshire would be moving into the pipeline\\nbusiness.  But upon completion of the Kern River expansion, MEHC will transport about 8% of all gas\\nused in the U.S.  We continue to look for large energy-related assets, though in the electric utility field\\nPUHCA constrains what we can do.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>A few years ago, and somewhat by accident, MEHC found itself in the residential real estate\\nbrokerage business.

In the various communities it serves, though, it\\noperates under the names of the businesses it has acquired, such as CBS in Omaha, Edina Realty in\\nMinneapolis and Iowa Realty in Des Moines.  In most metropolitan areas in which we operate, we are the\\nclear market leader.\\n</p>\\n<p>HomeServices is now the second largest residential brokerage business in the country.  On one\\nside or the other (or both), we participated in $37 billion of transactions last year, up 100% from 2001.\\n</p>\\n<p>Most of our growth came from three acquisitions we made during 2002, the largest of which was\\nPrudential California Realty.  Last year, this company, the leading realtor in a territory consisting of Los\\nAngeles, Orange and San Diego Counties, participated in $16 billion of closings.\\n</p>\\n<p>In a very short period, Ron Peltier, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, has increased HomeServices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 revenues \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nand profits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 dramatically.

       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>7\\n</p>\\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Our core business \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though we have others of great importance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is insurance.  To understand\\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all,\\nthe long-term outlook for both of these factors.\\n</p>\\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises\\nbecause premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.\\nDuring that time, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:\\nThe premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.\\nThat leaves it running an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderwriting loss,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if\\nits cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the\\nbusiness is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.  Moreover, the downward\\ntrend of interest rates in recent years has transformed underwriting losses that formerly were tolerable into\\nburdens that move insurance businesses deeply into the lemon category.\\n</p>\\n<p>Historically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost.  Indeed, our cost has been less than\\nzero in many years; that is, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually been paid for holding other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money.  In 2001, however,\\nour cost was terrible, coming in at 12.8%, about half of which was attributable to World Trade Center\\nlosses.  Back in 1983-84, we had years that were even worse.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing automatic about cheap float.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance operations since we entered the business 36 years ago upon acquiring National\\nIndemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included in the segment \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOther Primary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  For the table\\nwe have calculated our float \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by\\nadding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned\\npremium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid\\ntaxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.

       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>8\\n</p>\\n<p>Our 2002 results were hurt by 1) a painful charge at General Re for losses that should have been\\nrecorded as costs in earlier years, and 2) a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdesirable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d charge we incur annually for retroactive insurance (see\\nthe next section for more about these items).  These costs totaled $1.75 billion, or about 4.6% of float.\\nFortunately, our overall underwriting experience on 2002 business was excellent, which allowed us, even\\nafter the charges noted, to approach a no-cost result.\\n</p>\\n<p>Absent a megacatastrophe, I expect our cost of float in 2003 to again be very low \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps even less\\nthan zero.  In the rundown of our insurance operations that follows, you will see why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m optimistic that, over\\ntime, our underwriting results will both surpass those achieved by the industry and deliver us investable funds\\nat minimal cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance Operations\\n</p>\\n<p>If our insurance operations are to generate low-cost float over time, they must: (a) underwrite with\\nunwavering discipline; (b) reserve conservatively; and (c) avoid an aggregation of exposures that would allow\\na supposedly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpossible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d incident to threaten their solvency.  All of our major insurance businesses, with\\none exception, have regularly met those tests.\\n</p>\\n<p>The exception is General Re, and there was much to do at that company last year to get it up to\\nsnuff.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m delighted to report that under Joe Brandon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, and with yeoman assistance by Tad\\nMontross, enormous progress has been made on each of the fronts described.\\n</p>\\n<p>When I agreed in 1998 to merge Berkshire with Gen Re, I thought that company stuck to the three\\nrules I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve enumerated.  I had studied the operation for decades and had observed underwriting discipline that\\nwas consistent and reserving that was conservative.  At merger time, I detected no slippage in Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstandards.\\n</p>\\n<p>I was dead wrong.  Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture and practices had substantially changed and unbeknownst to\\nmanagement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and to me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the company was grossly mispricing its current business.  In addition, Gen Re had\\naccumulated an aggregation of risks that would have been fatal had, say, terrorists detonated several large-\\nscale nuclear bombs in an attack on the U.S.  A disaster of that scope was highly improbable, of course, but it\\nis up to insurers to limit their risks in a manner that leaves their finances rock-solid if the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpossible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhappens.  Indeed, had Gen Re remained independent, the World Trade Center attack alone would have\\nthreatened the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence.\\n</p>\\n<p>When the WTC disaster occurred, it exposed weaknesses in Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations that I should have\\ndetected earlier.  But I was lucky: Joe and Tad were on hand, freshly endowed with increased authority and\\neager to rapidly correct the errors of the past.  They knew what to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they did it.\\n</p>\\n<p>It takes time for insurance policies to run off, however, and 2002 was well along before we managed\\nto reduce our aggregation of nuclear, chemical and biological risk (NCB) to a tolerable level.  That problem is\\nnow behind us.\\n</p>\\n<p>On another front, Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting attitude has been dramatically altered: The entire\\norganization now understands that we wish to write only properly-priced business, whatever the effect on\\nvolume.  Joe and Tad judge themselves only by Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting profitability.  Size simply doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ncount.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, we are making every effort to get our reserving right.  If we fail at that, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know our\\ntrue costs.  And any insurer that has no idea what its costs are is heading for big trouble.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>9\\n</p>\\n<p>At yearend 2001, General Re attempted to reserve adequately for all losses that had occurred prior to\\nthat date and were not yet paid \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we failed badly.  Therefore the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2002 underwriting results\\nwere penalized by an additional $1.31 billion that we recorded to correct the estimation mistakes of earlier\\nyears.  When I review the reserving errors that have been uncovered at General Re, a line from a country song\\nseems apt: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know now what I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know then.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>I can promise you that our top priority going forward is to avoid inadequate reserving.  But I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nguarantee success.  The natural tendency of most casualty-insurance managers is to underreserve, and they\\nmust have a particular mindset \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which, it may surprise you, has nothing to do with actuarial expertise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if\\nthey are to overcome this devastating bias.  Additionally, a reinsurer faces far more difficulties in reserving\\nproperly than does a primary insurer.  Nevertheless, at Berkshire, we have generally been successful in our\\nreserving, and we are determined to be at General Re as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>In summary, I believe General Re is now well positioned to deliver huge amounts of no-cost float to\\nBerkshire and that its sink-the-ship catastrophe risk has been eliminated.  The company still possesses the\\nimportant competitive strengths that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve outlined in the past.  And it gained another highly significant\\nadvantage last year when each of its three largest worldwide competitors, previously rated AAA, was\\ndemoted by at least one rating agency.  Among the giants, General Re, rated AAA across-the-board, is now in\\na class by itself in respect to financial strength.\\n</p>\\n<p>No attribute is more important.  Recently, in contrast, one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest reinsurers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a\\ncompany regularly recommended to primary insurers by leading brokers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has all but ceased paying claims,\\nincluding those both valid and due.  This company owes many billions of dollars to hundreds of primary\\ninsurers who now face massive write-offs.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCheap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reinsurance is a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bargain: When an insurer lays out\\nmoney today in exchange for a reinsurer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise to pay a decade or two later, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dangerous \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and possibly\\nlife-threatening \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the insurer to deal with any but the strongest reinsurer around.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire shareholders owe Joe and Tad a huge thank you for their accomplishments in 2002.  They\\nworked harder during the year than I would wish for anyone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it is paying off.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>At GEICO, everything went so well in 2002 that we should pinch ourselves.

As anyone who knows him will attest, Tony has been in love with\\nGEICO for 41 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ever since he went to work for the company at 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and his results reflect this passion.\\nHe is proud of the money we save policyholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about $1 billion annually versus what other insurers, on\\naverage, would have charged them.  He is proud of the service we provide these policyholders: In a key\\nindustry survey, GEICO was recently ranked above all major competitors.  He is proud of his 19,162\\nassociates, who last year were awarded profit-sharing payments equal to 19% of their base salary because of\\nthe splendid results they achieved.  And he is proud of the growing profits he delivers to Berkshire\\nshareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO took in $2.9 billion in premiums when Berkshire acquired full ownership in 1996.  Last\\nyear, its volume was $6.9 billion, with plenty of growth to come.  Particularly promising is the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nInternet operation, whose new business grew by 75% last year.

In 1981-1983, the managers then running GEICO decided to try their\\nhand at writing commercial umbrella and product liability insurance.  The risks seemed modest: the company\\ntook in only $3,051,000 from this line and used almost all of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $2,979,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to buy reinsurance in order to\\nlimit its losses.  GEICO was left with a paltry $72,000 as compensation for the minor portion of the risk that\\nit retained.  But this small bite of the apple was more than enough to make the experience memorable.\\nGEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s losses from this venture now total a breathtaking $94.1 million or about 130,000% of the net\\npremium it received.  Of the total loss, uncollectable receivables from deadbeat reinsurers account for no less\\nthan $90.3 million (including $19 million charged in 2002).  So much for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccheap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reinsurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

In color!\\n</p>\\n<p>Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operation has amassed $13.4 billion of float, more than all but a handful of insurers have ever\\nbuilt up.  He accomplished this from a standing start in 1986, and even now has a workforce numbering only\\n20.  And, most important, he has produced underwriting profits.\\n</p>\\n<p>His profits are particularly remarkable if you factor in some accounting arcana that I am about to lay\\non you.

In this line of business, we\\nassume from another insurer the obligation to pay up to a specified amount for losses they have already\\nincurred \\xe2\\x80\\x93 often for events that took place decades earlier \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but that are yet to be paid (for example, because a\\nworker hurt in 1980 will receive monthly payments for life).  In these arrangements, an insurer pays us a large\\nupfront premium, but one that is less than the losses we expect to pay.  We willingly accept this differential\\nbecause a) our payments are capped, and b) we get to use the money until loss payments are actually made,\\nwith these often stretching out over a decade or more.  About 80% of the $6.6 billion in asbestos and\\nenvironmental loss reserves that we carry arises from capped contracts, whose costs consequently can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nskyrocket.\\n</p>\\n<p>When we write a retroactive policy, we immediately record both the premium and a reserve for the\\nexpected losses.  The difference between the two is entered as an asset entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeferred charges \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nreinsurance assumed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  This is no small item: at yearend, for all retroactive policies, it was $3.4 billion.  We\\nthen amortize this asset downward by charges to income over the expected life of each policy.  These charges\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 $440 million in 2002, including charges at Gen Re \\xe2\\x80\\x93 create an underwriting loss, but one that is intentional\\nand desirable.  And even after this drag on reported results, Ajit achieved a large underwriting gain last year.\\n</p>\\n<p>We want to emphasize, however, that we assume risks in Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operation that are huge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 far larger\\nthan those retained by any other insurer in the world.  Therefore, a single event could cause a major swing in\\nAjit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results in any given quarter or year.  That bothers us not at all: As long as we are paid appropriately, we\\nlove taking on short-term volatility that others wish to shed.  At Berkshire, we would rather earn a lumpy\\n15% over time than a smooth 12%.\\n</p>\\n<p>If you see Ajit at our annual meeting, bow deeply.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smaller insurers had an outstanding year.

Without this gain,\\nearnings from our training business would have fallen slightly in concert with the slowdown in\\nbusiness-aviation activity.  FlightSafety training continues to be the gold standard for the industry,\\nand we expect growth in the years to come.\\n</p>\\n<p>At NetJets, our fractional-ownership operation, we are the runaway leader of the four-company field.\\nFAA records indicate that our industry share in 2002 was 75%, meaning that clients purchased or\\nleased planes from us that were valued at triple those recorded by our three competitors combined.\\nLast year, our fleet flew 132.7 million nautical miles, taking clients to 130 countries.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our preeminence is directly attributable to Rich Santulli, NetJets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 CEO.  He invented the business in\\n1986 and ever since has exhibited an unbending devotion to the highest levels of service, safety and\\nsecurity.  Rich, Charlie and I insist on planes (and personnel) worthy of carrying our own families \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nbecause they regularly do.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though NetJets revenues set a record in 2002, the company again lost money.  A small profit in the\\nU.S. was more than offset by losses in Europe.  Overall, the fractional-ownership industry lost\\nsignificant sums last year, and that is almost certain to be the outcome in 2003 as well.  The bald fact\\nis that airplanes are costly to operate.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, this economic reality should work to our advantage, given that for a great many\\ncompanies, private aircraft are an essential business tool.  And for most of these companies, NetJets\\nmakes compelling sense as either a primary or supplementary supplier of the aircraft they need.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many businesses could save millions of dollars annually by flying with us.  Indeed, the yearly\\nsavings at some large companies could exceed $10 million.  Equally important, these companies\\nwould actually increase their operational capabilities by using us.  A fractional ownership of a single\\nNetJets plane allows a client to have several planes in the air simultaneously.  Additionally, through\\nthe interchange arrangement we make available, an owner of an interest in one plane can fly any of\\n12 other models, using whatever plane makes most sense for a mission.  (One of my sisters owns a\\nfraction of a Falcon 2000, which she uses for trips to Hawaii, but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 exhibiting the Buffett gene \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she\\ninterchanges to a more economical Citation Excel for short trips in the U.S.)\\n</p>\\n<p>The roster of NetJets users confirms the advantages we offer major businesses.

I like this division of labor and hope to join with Leucadia in future transactions.\\n</p>\\n<p>On the minus side, the Finance line also includes the operations of General Re Securities, a\\nderivatives and trading business.  This entity lost $173 million pre-tax last year, a result that, in part,\\nis a belated acknowledgment of faulty, albeit standard, accounting it used in earlier periods.\\nDerivatives, in fact, deserve an extensive look, both in respect to the accounting their users employ\\nand to the problems they may pose for both individual companies and our economy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Derivatives\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with\\nthem: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system.\\n</p>\\n<p>Having delivered that thought, which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get back to, let me retreat to explaining derivatives, though\\nthe explanation must be general because the word covers an extraordinarily wide range of financial contracts.\\nEssentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be\\ndetermined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values.  If, for\\nexample, you are either long or short an S&amp;P 500 futures contract, you are a party to a very simple derivatives\\ntransaction \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with your gain or loss derived from movements in the index.  Derivatives contracts are of\\nvarying duration (running sometimes to 20 or more years) and their value is often tied to several variables.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the\\ncreditworthiness of the counterparties to them.  In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the\\ncounterparties record profits and losses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 often huge in amount \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in their current earnings statements without\\nso much as a penny changing hands.\\n</p>\\n<p>The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it\\nseems, madmen).  At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years\\nin the future, were put on the books.  Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins\\nto be born in Nebraska in 2020.  No problem \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty.\\n</p>\\n<p>When we purchased Gen Re, it came with General Re Securities, a derivatives dealer that Charlie\\nand I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want, judging it to be dangerous.  We failed in our attempts to sell the operation, however, and\\nare now terminating it.\\n</p>\\n<p>But closing down a derivatives business is easier said than done.  It will be a great many years before\\nwe are totally out of this operation (though we reduce our exposure daily).  In fact, the reinsurance and\\nderivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit.  In either\\nindustry, once you write a contract \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which may require a large payment decades later \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you are usually stuck\\nwith it.  True, there are methods by which the risk can be laid off with others.  But most strategies of that kind\\nleave you with residual liability.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another commonality of reinsurance and derivatives is that both generate reported earnings that are\\noften wildly overstated.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true because today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings are in a significant way based on estimates\\nwhose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Errors will usually be honest, reflecting only the human tendency to take an optimistic view of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncommitments.  But the parties to derivatives also have enormous incentives to cheat in accounting for them.\\nThose who trade derivatives are usually paid (in whole or part) on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d calculated by mark-to-market\\naccounting.  But often there is no real market (think about our contract involving twins) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmark-to-model\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nis utilized.  This substitution can bring on large-scale mischief.  As a general rule, contracts involving\\nmultiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counterparties to use\\nfanciful assumptions.  In the twins scenario, for example, the two parties to the contract might well use\\ndiffering models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years.  In extreme cases, mark-to-model\\ndegenerates into what I would call mark-to-myth.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, both internal and outside auditors review the numbers, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no easy job.  For\\nexample, General Re Securities at yearend (after ten months of winding down its operation) had 14,384</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>14\\n</p>\\n<p>contracts outstanding, involving 672 counterparties around the world.  Each contract had a plus or minus\\nvalue derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity.  Valuing a\\nportfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.\\n</p>\\n<p>The valuation problem is far from academic: In recent years, some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds\\nhave been facilitated by derivatives trades.  In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, companies\\nused derivatives and trading activities to report great \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 until the roof fell in when they actually\\ntried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on their balance sheets into cash.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMark-to-market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then\\nturned out to be truly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmark-to-myth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>I can assure you that the marking errors in the derivatives business have not been symmetrical.\\nAlmost invariably, they have favored either the trader who was eyeing a multi-million dollar bonus or the\\nCEO who wanted to report impressive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (or both).  The bonuses were paid, and the CEO profited\\nfrom his options.  Only much later did shareholders learn that the reported earnings were a sham.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another problem about derivatives is that they can exacerbate trouble that a corporation has run into\\nfor completely unrelated reasons.  This pile-on effect occurs because many derivatives contracts require that a\\ncompany suffering a credit downgrade immediately supply collateral to counterparties.  Imagine, then, that a\\ncompany is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their\\nrequirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company.  The need to\\nmeet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more\\ndowngrades.  It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown.\\n</p>\\n<p>Derivatives also create a daisy-chain risk that is akin to the risk run by insurers or reinsurers that lay\\noff much of their business with others.  In both cases, huge receivables from many counterparties tend to\\nbuild up over time.  (At Gen Re Securities, we still have $6.5 billion of receivables, though we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in a\\nliquidation mode for nearly a year.)  A participant may see himself as prudent, believing his large credit\\nexposures to be diversified and therefore not dangerous.  Under certain circumstances, though, an exogenous\\nevent that causes the receivable from Company A to go bad will also affect those from Companies B through\\nZ.  History teaches us that a crisis often causes problems to correlate in a manner undreamed of in more\\ntranquil times.\\n</p>\\n<p>In banking, the recognition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clinkage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d problem was one of the reasons for the formation of the\\nFederal Reserve System.  Before the Fed was established, the failure of weak banks would sometimes put\\nsudden and unanticipated liquidity demands on previously-strong banks, causing them to fail in turn.  The\\nFed now insulates the strong from the troubles of the weak.  But there is no central bank assigned to the job of\\npreventing the dominoes toppling in insurance or derivatives.  In these industries, firms that are\\nfundamentally solid can become troubled simply because of the travails of other firms further down the chain.\\nWhen a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchain reaction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d threat exists within an industry, it pays to minimize links of any kind.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how\\nwe conduct our reinsurance business, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one reason we are exiting derivatives.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many people argue that derivatives reduce systemic problems, in that participants who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bear\\ncertain risks are able to transfer them to stronger hands.  These people believe that derivatives act to stabilize\\nthe economy, facilitate trade, and eliminate bumps for individual participants.  And, on a micro level, what\\nthey say is often true.  Indeed, at Berkshire, I sometimes engage in large-scale derivatives transactions in\\norder to facilitate certain investment strategies.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe, however, that the macro picture is dangerous and getting more so.  Large\\namounts of risk, particularly credit risk, have become concentrated in the hands of relatively few derivatives\\ndealers, who in addition trade extensively with one other.  The troubles of one could quickly infect the others.\\nOn top of that, these dealers are owed huge amounts by non-dealer counterparties.  Some of these\\ncounterparties, as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned, are linked in ways that could cause them to contemporaneously run into a\\nproblem because of a single event (such as the implosion of the telecom industry or the precipitous decline in\\nthe value of merchant power projects).  Linkage, when it suddenly surfaces, can trigger serious systemic\\nproblems.\\n</p>\\n<p>Indeed, in 1998, the leveraged and derivatives-heavy activities of a single hedge fund, Long-Term\\nCapital Management, caused the Federal Reserve anxieties so severe that it hastily orchestrated a rescue\\neffort.  In later Congressional testimony, Fed officials acknowledged that, had they not intervened, the\\noutstanding trades of LTCM \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a firm unknown to the general public and employing only a few hundred</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>15\\n</p>\\n<p>people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 could well have posed a serious threat to the stability of American markets.  In other words, the Fed\\nacted because its leaders were fearful of what might have happened to other financial institutions had the\\nLTCM domino toppled. And this affair, though it paralyzed many parts of the fixed-income market for\\nweeks, was far from a worst-case scenario.\\n</p>\\n<p>One of the derivatives instruments that LTCM used was total-return swaps, contracts that facilitate\\n100% leverage in various markets, including stocks.  For example, Party A to a contract, usually a bank, puts\\nup all of the money for the purchase of a stock while Party B, without putting up any capital, agrees that at a\\nfuture date it will receive any gain or pay any loss that the bank realizes.\\n</p>\\n<p>Total-return swaps of this type make a joke of margin requirements.  Beyond that, other types of\\nderivatives severely curtail the ability of regulators to curb leverage and generally get their arms around the\\nrisk profiles of banks, insurers and other financial institutions.  Similarly, even experienced investors and\\nanalysts encounter major problems in analyzing the financial condition of firms that are heavily involved with\\nderivatives contracts.  When Charlie and I finish reading the long footnotes detailing the derivatives activities\\nof major banks, the only thing we understand is that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand how much risk the institution is\\nrunning.\\n</p>\\n<p>The derivatives genie is now well out of the bottle, and these instruments will almost certainly\\nmultiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear.  Knowledge of how dangerous\\nthey are has already permeated the electricity and gas businesses, in which the eruption of major troubles\\ncaused the use of derivatives to diminish dramatically.  Elsewhere, however, the derivatives business\\ncontinues to expand unchecked.  Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to\\ncontrol, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe Berkshire should be a fortress of financial strength \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for the sake of our\\nowners, creditors, policyholders and employees.  We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and\\nthat posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives\\ncontracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside.

We love owning\\ncommon stocks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if they can be purchased at attractive prices.  In my 61 years of investing, 50 or so years\\nhave offered that kind of opportunity.  There will be years like that again.  Unless, however, we see a very\\nhigh probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translate to 6\\xc2\\xbd-7% after corporate tax), we will sit on\\nthe sidelines.  With short-term money returning less than 1% after-tax, sitting it out is no fun.

But there are important differences between the two disciplines as well.  In stocks, we\\nexpect every commitment to work out well because we concentrate on conservatively financed businesses\\nwith strong competitive strengths, run by able and honest people.  If we buy into these companies at sensible\\nprices, losses should be rare.  Indeed, during the 38 years we have run the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs, gains from the\\nequities we manage at Berkshire (that is, excluding those managed at General Re and GEICO) have exceeded\\nlosses by a ratio of about 100 to one.\\n</p>\\n<p>Purchasing junk bonds, we are dealing with enterprises that are far more marginal.  These businesses\\nare usually overloaded with debt and often operate in industries characterized by low returns on capital.\\nAdditionally, the quality of management is sometimes questionable.  Management may even have interests\\nthat are directly counter to those of debtholders.  Therefore, we expect that we will have occasional large\\nlosses in junk issues.  So far, however, we have done reasonably well in this field.\\n</p>\\n<p>Corporate Governance\\n</p>\\n<p>Both the ability and fidelity of managers have long needed monitoring.  Indeed, nearly 2,000 years\\nago, Jesus Christ addressed this subject, speaking (Luke 16:2) approvingly of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca certain rich man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who told\\nhis manager, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest no longer be steward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Accountability and stewardship withered in the last decade, becoming qualities deemed of little\\nimportance by those caught up in the Great Bubble.  As stock prices went up, the behavioral norms of\\nmanagers went down.  By the late \\xe2\\x80\\x9990s, as a result, CEOs who traveled the high road did not encounter heavy\\ntraffic.\\n</p>\\n<p>Most CEOs, it should be noted, are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your\\nchildren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets or as next-door neighbors.  Too many of these people, however, have in recent years\\nbehaved badly at the office, fudging numbers and drawing obscene pay for mediocre business achievements.\\nThese otherwise decent people simply followed the career path of Mae West: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was Snow White but I\\ndrifted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>In theory, corporate boards should have prevented this deterioration of conduct.  I last wrote about\\nthe responsibilities of directors in the 1993 annual report.  (We will send you a copy of this discussion on\\nrequest, or you may read it on the Internet in the Corporate Governance section of the 1993 letter.)  There, I\\nsaid that directors \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould behave as if there was a single absentee owner, whose long-term interest they\\nshould try to further in all proper ways.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  This means that directors must get rid of a manager who is mediocre\\nor worse, no matter how likable he may be.  Directors must react as did the chorus-girl bride of an 85-year-\\nold multimillionaire when he asked whether she would love him if he lost his money.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the young\\nbeauty replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would miss you, but I would still love you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>In the 1993 annual report, I also said directors had another job: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf able but greedy managers over-\\nreach and try to dip too deeply into the shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pockets, directors must slap their hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Since I wrote\\nthat, over-reaching has become common but few hands have been slapped.\\n</p>\\n<p>Why have intelligent and decent directors failed so miserably?

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equally awkward to question a proposed acquisition\\nthat has been endorsed by the CEO, particularly when his inside staff and outside advisors are present and\\nunanimously support his decision.  (They wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in the room if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.)  Finally, when the\\ncompensation committee \\xe2\\x80\\x93 armed, as always, with support from a high-paid consultant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reports on a\\nmegagrant of options to the CEO, it would be like belching at the dinner table for a director to suggest that the\\ncommittee reconsider.\\n</p>\\n<p>These \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d difficulties argue for outside directors regularly meeting without the CEO \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a reform\\nthat is being instituted and that I enthusiastically endorse.

It is certainly true that it is desirable to have directors\\nwho think and speak independently \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they must also be business-savvy, interested and shareholder-\\noriented.  In my 1993 commentary, those are the three qualities I described as essential.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over a span of 40 years, I have been on 19 public-company boards (excluding Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) and have\\ninteracted with perhaps 250 directors.  Most of them were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as defined by today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rules.  But the\\ngreat majority of these directors lacked at least one of the three qualities I value.  As a result, their\\ncontribution to shareholder well-being was minimal at best and, too often, negative.  These people, decent and\\nintelligent though they were, simply did not know enough about business and/or care enough about\\nshareholders to question foolish acquisitions or egregious compensation.  My own behavior, I must ruefully\\nadd, frequently fell short as well: Too often I was silent when management made proposals that I judged to be\\ncounter to the interests of shareholders.  In those cases, collegiality trumped independence.\\n</p>\\n<p>So that we may further see the failings of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at a 62-year case study covering\\nthousands of companies.  Since 1940, federal law has mandated that a large proportion of the directors of\\ninvestment companies (most of these mutual funds) be independent.  The requirement was originally 40% and\\nnow it is 50%.  In any case, the typical fund has long operated with a majority of directors who qualify as\\nindependent.\\n</p>\\n<p>These directors and the entire board have many perfunctory duties, but in actuality have only two\\nimportant responsibilities: obtaining the best possible investment manager and negotiating with that manager\\nfor the lowest possible fee.  When you are seeking investment help yourself, those two goals are the only ones\\nthat count, and directors acting for other investors should have exactly the same priorities.  Yet when it comes\\nto independent directors pursuing either goal, their record has been absolutely pathetic.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many thousands of investment-company boards meet annually to carry out the vital job of selecting\\nwho will manage the savings of the millions of owners they represent.  Year after year the directors of Fund\\nA select manager A, Fund B directors select manager B, etc. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 in a zombie-like process that makes a\\nmockery of stewardship.  Very occasionally, a board will revolt.  But for the most part, a monkey will type\\nout a Shakespeare play before an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mutual-fund director will suggest that his fund look at other\\nmanagers, even if the incumbent manager has persistently delivered substandard performance.  When they are\\nhandling their own money, of course, directors will look to alternative advisors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but it never enters their\\nminds to do so when they are acting as fiduciaries for others.\\n</p>\\n<p>The hypocrisy permeating the system is vividly exposed when a fund management company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 call it\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is sold for a huge sum to Manager \\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Now the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d directors experience a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccounter-\\nrevelation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and decide that Manager B is the best that can be found \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though B was available (and\\nignored) in previous years.  Not so incidentally, B also could formerly have been hired at a far lower rate than\\nis possible now that it has bought Manager A.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because B has laid out a fortune to acquire A, and B\\nmust now recoup that cost through fees paid by the A shareholders who were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelivered\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as part of the deal.\\n(For a terrific discussion of the mutual fund business, read John Bogle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Common Sense on Mutual Funds.)\\n</p>\\n<p>A few years ago, my daughter was asked to become a director of a family of funds managed by a\\nmajor institution.  The fees she would have received as a director were very substantial, enough to have\\nincreased her annual income by about 50% (a boost, she will tell you, she could use!).  Legally, she would\\nhave been an independent director.  But did the fund manager who approached her think there was any\\nchance that she would think independently as to what advisor the fund should employ?  Of course not.

       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>18\\n</p>\\n<p>proud to say that she showed real independence by turning down the offer.  The fund, however, had no\\ntrouble filling the slot (and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 surprise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the fund has not changed managers).\\n</p>\\n<p>Investment company directors have failed as well in negotiating management fees (just as\\ncompensation committees of many American companies have failed to hold the compensation of their CEOs\\nto sensible levels).  If you or I were empowered, I can assure you that we could easily negotiate materially\\nlower management fees with the incumbent managers of most mutual funds.  And, believe me, if directors\\nwere promised a portion of any fee savings they realized, the skies would be filled with falling fees.  Under\\nthe current system, though, reductions mean nothing to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d directors while meaning everything to\\nmanagers.  So guess who wins?\\n</p>\\n<p>Having the right money manager, of course, is far more important to a fund than reducing the\\nmanager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fee.  Both tasks are nonetheless the job of directors.  And in stepping up to these all-important\\nresponsibilities, tens of thousands of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d directors, over more than six decades, have failed\\nmiserably.  (They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve succeeded, however, in taking care of themselves; their fees from serving on multiple\\nboards of a single \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of funds often run well into six figures.)\\n</p>\\n<p>When the manager cares deeply and the directors don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needed is a powerful countervailing\\nforce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the missing element in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corporate governance.  Getting rid of mediocre CEOs and\\neliminating overreaching by the able ones requires action by owners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 big owners.  The logistics aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that\\ntough: The ownership of stock has grown increasingly concentrated in recent decades, and today it would be\\neasy for institutional managers to exert their will on problem situations.  Twenty, or even fewer, of the largest\\ninstitutions, acting together, could effectively reform corporate governance at a given company, simply by\\nwithholding their votes for directors who were tolerating odious behavior.  In my view, this kind of concerted\\naction is the only way that corporate stewardship can be meaningfully improved.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, certain major investing institutions have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglass house\\xe2\\x80\\x9d problems in arguing for better\\ngovernance elsewhere; they would shudder, for example, at the thought of their own performance and fees\\nbeing closely inspected by their own boards.  But Jack Bogle of Vanguard fame, Chris Davis of Davis\\nAdvisors, and Bill Miller of Legg Mason are now offering leadership in getting CEOs to treat their owners\\nproperly.  Pension funds, as well as other fiduciaries, will reap better investment returns in the future if they\\nsupport these men.\\n</p>\\n<p>The acid test for reform will be CEO compensation.  Managers will cheerfully agree to board\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiversity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attest to SEC filings and adopt meaningless proposals relating to process.  What many will fight,\\nhowever, is a hard look at their own pay and perks.\\n</p>\\n<p>In recent years compensation committees too often have been tail-wagging puppy dogs meekly\\nfollowing recommendations by consultants, a breed not known for allegiance to the faceless shareholders who\\npay their fees.  (If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell whose side someone is on, they are not on yours.)  True, each committee is\\nrequired by the SEC to state its reasoning about pay in the proxy.  But the words are usually boilerplate\\nwritten by the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers or its human-relations department.\\n</p>\\n<p>This costly charade should cease.  Directors should not serve on compensation committees unless\\nthey are themselves capable of negotiating on behalf of owners.  They should explain both how they think\\nabout pay and how they measure performance.

It baffles me how the many directors who look to these dollars for\\nperhaps 20% or more of their annual income can be considered independent when Ron Olson, for example,\\nwho is on our board, may be deemed not independent because he receives a tiny percentage of his very large\\nincome from Berkshire legal fees.  As the investment company saga suggests, a director whose moderate\\nincome is heavily dependent on directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and who hopes mightily to be invited to join other boards in\\norder to earn more fees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is highly unlikely to offend a CEO or fellow directors, who in a major way will\\ndetermine his reputation in corporate circles.

Haste\\nis the enemy of accuracy.  My thinking, in fact, is that the SEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent shortening of reporting deadlines will\\nhurt the quality of information that shareholders receive.  Charlie and I believe that rule is a mistake and\\nshould be rescinded.\\n</p>\\n<p>The primary advantage of our four questions is that they will act as a prophylactic.  Once the\\nauditors know that the audit committee will require them to affirmatively endorse, rather than merely\\nacquiesce to, management\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions, they will resist misdoings early in the process, well before specious\\nfigures become embedded in the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s books. Fear of the plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bar will see to that.\\n</p>\\n<p> * * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>The Chicago Tribune ran a four-part series on Arthur Andersen last September that did a great job of\\nilluminating how accounting standards and audit quality have eroded in recent years.  A few decades ago, an\\nArthur Andersen audit opinion was the gold standard of the profession.  Within the firm, an elite Professional\\nStandards Group (PSG) insisted on honest reporting, no matter what pressures were applied by the client.\\nSticking to these principles, the PSG took a stand in 1992 that the cost of stock options should be recorded as\\nthe expense it clearly was.  The PSG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position was reversed, however, by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crainmaking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d partners of\\nAndersen who knew what their clients wanted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 higher reported earnings no matter what the reality.  Many\\nCEOs also fought expensing because they knew that the obscene megagrants of options they craved would be\\nslashed if the true costs of these had to be recorded.\\n</p>\\n<p>Soon after the Andersen reversal, the independent accounting standards board (FASB) voted 7-0 for\\nexpensing options.  Predictably, the major auditing firms and an army of CEOs stormed Washington to\\npressure the Senate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what better institution to decide accounting questions? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 into castrating the FASB.  The\\nvoices of the protesters were amplified by their large political contributions, usually made with corporate\\nmoney belonging to the very owners about to be bamboozled.  It was not a sight for a civics class.\\n</p>\\n<p>To its shame, the Senate voted 88-9 against expensing.  Several prominent Senators even called for\\nthe demise of the FASB if it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t abandon its position.  (So much for independence.)  Arthur Levitt, Jr., then\\nChairman of the SEC \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and generally a vigilant champion of shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has since described his reluctant</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>21\\n</p>\\n<p>bowing to Congressional and corporate pressures as the act of his chairmanship that he most regrets.  (The\\ndetails of this sordid affair are related in Levitt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excellent book, Take on the Street.)\\n</p>\\n<p>With the Senate in its pocket and the SEC outgunned, corporate America knew that it was now boss\\nwhen it came to accounting.  With that, a new era of anything-goes earnings reports \\xe2\\x80\\x93 blessed and, in some\\ncases, encouraged by big-name auditors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was launched.  The licentious behavior that followed quickly\\nbecame an air pump for The Great Bubble.\\n</p>\\n<p>After being threatened by the Senate, FASB backed off its original position and adopted an \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonor\\nsystem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach, declaring expensing to be preferable but also allowing companies to ignore the cost if they\\nwished.  The disheartening result: Of the 500 companies in the S&amp;P, 498 adopted the method deemed less\\ndesirable, which of course let them report higher \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Compensation-hungry CEOs loved this\\noutcome: Let FASB have the honor; they had the system.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our 1992 annual report, discussing the unseemly and self-serving behavior of so many CEOs, I\\nsaid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe business elite risks losing its credibility on issues of significance to society \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about which it may\\nhave much of value to say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when it advocates the incredible on issues of significance to itself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>That loss of credibility has occurred.  The job of CEOs is now to regain America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and for the\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that they do so.  They will not succeed in this endeavor, however, by way of\\nfatuous ads, meaningless policy statements, or structural changes of boards and committees.  Instead, CEOs\\nmust embrace stewardship as a way of life and treat their owners as partners, not patsies.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for CEOs\\nto walk the walk.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Three suggestions for investors: First, beware of companies displaying weak accounting.  If a\\ncompany still does not expense options, or if its pension assumptions are fanciful, watch out.  When\\nmanagements take the low road in aspects that are visible, it is likely they are following a similar path behind\\nthe scenes.  There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen.\\n</p>\\n<p>Trumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly\\npernicious practice.  Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-cash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ncharge.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nonsense.  In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay\\nit represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business.  Imagine, if\\nyou will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of their\\nservice (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years).  In the following nine\\nyears, compensation would be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-cash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expense \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset\\nestablished this year.  Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten\\nwould be simply a bookkeeping formality?\\n</p>\\n<p>Second, unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management.  If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nunderstand a footnote or other managerial explanation, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s usually because the CEO doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want you to.\\nEnron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s descriptions of certain transactions still baffle me.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations.\\nBusinesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advance\\nsmoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers).\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I not only don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know today what our businesses will earn next year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even\\nknow what they will earn next quarter.  We are suspicious of those CEOs who regularly claim they do know\\nthe future \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we become downright incredulous if they consistently reach their declared targets.

Over the last 39 years (that is, since present management took\\nover) per-share book value has grown from $19 to $50,498, a rate of 22.2% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic value that counts, however, not book value.  Here, the news is good:\\nBetween 1964 and 2003, Berkshire morphed from a struggling northern textile business whose intrinsic\\nvalue was less than book into a widely diversified enterprise worth far more than book.  Our 39-year gain\\nin intrinsic value has therefore somewhat exceeded our 22.2% gain in book.  (For a better understanding of\\nintrinsic value and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice-\\nchairman, and me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual, beginning on page 69.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite their shortcomings, book value calculations are useful at Berkshire as a slightly\\nunderstated gauge for measuring the long-term rate of increase in our intrinsic value.  The calculation is\\nless relevant, however, than it once was in rating any single year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance versus the S&amp;P 500 index\\n(a comparison we display on the facing page).  Our equity holdings, including convertible preferreds, have\\nfallen considerably as a percentage of our net worth, from an average of 114% in the 1980s, for example, to\\nan average of 50% in 2000-03.  Therefore, yearly movements in the stock market now affect a much\\nsmaller portion of our net worth than was once the case.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nonetheless, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term performance versus the S&amp;P remains all-important.  Our\\nshareholders can buy the S&amp;P through an index fund at very low cost.  Unless we achieve gains in per-\\nshare intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&amp;P\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance, Charlie and I will be adding nothing to\\nwhat you can accomplish on your own.\\n</p>\\n<p>If we fail, we will have no excuses.  Charlie and I operate in an ideal environment.  To begin with,\\nwe are supported by an incredible group of men and women who run our operating units.  If there were a\\nCorporate Cooperstown, its roster would surely include many of our CEOs.  Any shortfall in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nresults will not be caused by our managers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, we enjoy a rare sort of managerial freedom.  Most companies are saddled with\\ninstitutional constraints.  A company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, for example, may commit it to an industry that now offers\\nlimited opportunity.  A more common problem is a shareholder constituency that pressures its manager to\\ndance to Wall Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tune.  Many CEOs resist, but others give in and adopt operating and capital-\\nallocation policies far different from those they would choose if left to themselves.  \\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, neither history nor the demands of owners impede intelligent decision-making.\\nWhen Charlie and I make mistakes, they are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in tennis parlance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unforced errors.\\n</p>\\n<p>                                                                 \\n*All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares, the successor to the only stock that\\n</p>\\n<p>the company had outstanding before 1996.

In buying businesses, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some terrible mistakes, both of commission\\nand omission. Overall, however, our acquisitions have led to decent gains in per-share earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Below is a table that quantifies that point.  But first we need to warn you that growth-rate\\npresentations can be significantly distorted by a calculated selection of either initial or terminal dates.  For\\nexample, if earnings are tiny in a beginning year, a long-term performance that was only mediocre can be\\nmade to appear sensational.  That kind of distortion can come about because the company at issue was\\nminuscule in the base year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which means that only a handful of insiders actually benefited from the touted\\nperformance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or because a larger company was then operating at just above breakeven.  Picking a terminal\\nyear that is particularly buoyant will also favorably bias a calculation of growth.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Berkshire Hathaway that present management assumed control of in 1965 had long been\\nsizable.  But in 1964, it earned only $175,586 or 15 cents per share, so close to breakeven that any\\ncalculation of earnings growth from that base would be meaningless.  At the time, however, even those\\nmeager earnings looked good:  Over the decade following the 1955 merger of Berkshire Fine Spinning\\nAssociates and Hathaway Manufacturing, the combined operation had lost $10.1 million and many\\nthousands of employees had been let go.  It was not a marriage made in heaven.\\n</p>\\n<p>Against this background, we give you a picture of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings growth that begins in\\n1968, but also includes subsequent base years spaced five years apart.  A series of calculations is presented\\nso that you can decide for yourself which period is most meaningful.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started with 1968 because it was\\nthe first full year we operated National Indemnity, the initial acquisition we made as we began to expand\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business.\\n</p>\\n<p>I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe that using 2003 as the terminal year distorts our calculations.  It was a terrific year\\nfor our insurance business, but the big boost that gave to earnings was largely offset by the pathetically low\\ninterest rates we earned on our large holdings of cash equivalents (a condition that will not last).

None, however,\\nhad a more unusual genesis than our purchase last year of Clayton Homes.\\n</p>\\n<p>The unlikely source was a group of finance students from the University of Tennessee, and their\\nteacher, Dr. Al Auxier.   For the past five years, Al has brought his class to Omaha, where the group tours\\nNebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, eats at Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and then comes to Kiewit Plaza for a session with\\nme.  Usually about 40 students participate.\\n</p>\\n<p>After two hours of give-and-take, the group traditionally presents me with a thank-you gift.  (The\\ndoors stay locked until they do.)  In past years it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been items such as a football signed by Phil Fulmer and\\na basketball from Tennessee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team.\\n</p>\\n<p>This past February, the group opted for a book \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which, luckily for me, was the recently-published\\nautobiography of Jim Clayton, founder of Clayton Homes.  I already knew the company to be the class act\\nof the manufactured housing industry, knowledge I acquired after earlier making the mistake of buying\\nsome distressed junk debt of Oakwood Homes, one of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest companies.  At the time of that\\npurchase, I did not understand how atrocious consumer-financing practices had become throughout most of\\nthe manufactured housing industry.  But I learned: Oakwood rather promptly went bankrupt.\\n</p>\\n<p>Manufactured housing, it should be emphasized, can deliver very good value to home purchasers.\\nIndeed, for decades, the industry has accounted for more than 15% of the homes built in the U.S.  During\\nthose years, moreover, both the quality and variety of manufactured houses consistently improved.\\n</p>\\n<p>Progress in design and construction was not matched, however, by progress in distribution and\\nfinancing. Instead, as the years went by, the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business model increasingly centered on the ability\\nof both the retailer and manufacturer to unload terrible loans on naive lenders.  When \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecuritization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then\\nbecame popular in the 1990s, further distancing the supplier of funds from the lending transaction, the\\nindustry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct went from bad to worse.  Much of its volume a few years back came from buyers who\\nshouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have bought, financed by lenders who shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have lent.  The consequence has been huge\\nnumbers of repossessions and pitifully low recoveries on the units repossessed.\\n</p>\\n<p>Oakwood participated fully in the insanity.  But Clayton, though it could not isolate itself from\\nindustry practices, behaved considerably better than its major competitors.\\n</p>\\n<p>Upon receiving Jim Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, I told the students how much I admired his record and they\\ntook that message back to Knoxville, home of both the University of Tennessee and Clayton Homes.  Al\\nthen suggested that I call Kevin Clayton, Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son and the CEO, to express my views directly.  As I talked\\nwith Kevin, it became clear that he was both able and a straight-shooter.\\n</p>\\n<p>Soon thereafter, I made an offer for the business based solely on Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, my evaluation of\\nKevin, the public financials of Clayton and what I had learned from the Oakwood experience.  Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nboard was receptive, since it understood that the large-scale financing Clayton would need in the future\\nmight be hard to get.

This tightening was particularly serious\\nfor Clayton, whose earnings significantly depended on  securitizations.\\n</p>\\n<p>Today, the manufactured housing industry remains awash in problems.  Delinquencies continue\\nhigh, repossessed units still abound and the number of retailers has been halved.  A different business\\nmodel is required, one that eliminates the ability of the retailer and salesman to pocket substantial money\\nup front by making sales financed by loans that are destined to default.  Such transactions cause hardship to\\nboth buyer and lender and lead to a flood of repossessions that then undercut the sale of new units.  Under a\\nproper model \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one requiring significant down payments and shorter-term loans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the industry will likely\\nremain much smaller than it was in the 90s.  But it will deliver to home buyers an asset in which they will\\nhave equity, rather than disappointment, upon resale.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull circle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d department, Clayton has agreed to buy the assets of Oakwood.  When the\\ntransaction closes, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manufacturing capacity, geographical reach and sales outlets will be\\nsubstantially increased.  As a byproduct, the debt of Oakwood that we own, which we bought at a deep\\ndiscount, will probably return a small profit to us.  \\n</p>\\n<p>And the students?  In October, we had a surprise \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgraduation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ceremony in Knoxville for the 40\\nwho sparked my interest in Clayton.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\na good business, but one not in the mainstream of Wal-Mart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future.

As is required, we dutifully filed two copies of this return, creating a pile of paper seven feet\\ntall.

The return\\ncovered three pages.  After I claimed the appropriate business deductions, such as $35 for a bicycle, my tax\\nbill was $7.

But it should look to Congress and the Administration for redress, not to Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Corporate income taxes in fiscal 2003 accounted for 7.4% of all federal tax receipts, down from a\\npost-war peak of 32% in 1952.  With one exception (1983), last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s percentage is the lowest recorded\\nsince data was first published in 1934.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even so, tax breaks for corporations (and their investors, particularly large ones) were a major part\\nof the Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2002 and 2003 initiatives.  If class warfare is being waged in America, my class is\\nclearly winning.  Today, many large corporations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 run by CEOs whose fiddle-playing talents make your\\nChairman look like he is all thumbs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pay nothing close to the stated federal tax rate of 35%.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1985, Berkshire paid $132 million in federal income taxes, and all corporations paid $61\\nbillion.  The comparable amounts in 1995 were $286 million and $157 billion respectively.  And, as\\nmentioned, we will pay about $3.3 billion for 2003, a year when all corporations paid $132 billion.  We\\nhope our taxes continue to rise in the future \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it will mean we are prospering \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we also hope that the\\nrest of Corporate America antes up along with us.  This might be a project for Ms. Olson to work on.\\n</p>\\n<p>Corporate Governance\\n</p>\\n<p>In judging whether Corporate America is serious about reforming itself, CEO pay remains the acid\\ntest.  To date, the results aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t encouraging.  A few CEOs, such as Jeff Immelt of General Electric, have\\nled the way in initiating programs that are fair to managers and shareholders alike.  Generally, however, his\\nexample has been more admired than followed.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understandable how pay got out of hand.  When management hires employees, or when\\ncompanies bargain with a vendor, the intensity of interest is equal on both sides of the table.  One party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngain is the other party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss, and the money involved has real meaning to both.  The result is an honest-to-\\nGod negotiation.\\n</p>\\n<p>But when CEOs (or their representatives) have met with compensation committees, too often one\\nside \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has cared far more than the other about what bargain is struck.  A CEO, for example,\\nwill always regard the difference between receiving options for 100,000 shares or for 500,000 as\\nmonumental.

But the question of what truly motivates independence has largely been neglected.\\n</p>\\n<p>In last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report, I took a look at how \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d directors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as defined by statute \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had\\nperformed in the mutual fund field.  The Investment Company Act of 1940 mandated such directors, and\\nthat means we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had an extended test of what statutory standards produce.  In our examination last year,\\nwe looked at the record of fund directors in respect to the two key tasks board members should perform \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nwhether at a mutual fund business or any other.  These two all-important functions are, first, to obtain (or\\nretain) an able and honest manager and then to compensate that manager fairly.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our survey was not encouraging.  Year after year, at literally thousands of funds, directors had\\nroutinely rehired the incumbent management company, however pathetic its performance had been.  Just as\\nroutinely, the directors had mindlessly approved fees that in many cases far exceeded those that could have\\nbeen negotiated.  Then, when a management company was sold \\xe2\\x80\\x93 invariably at a huge price relative to\\ntangible assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the directors experienced a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccounter-revelation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and immediately signed on with the new\\nmanager and accepted its fee schedule.  In effect, the directors decided that whoever would pay the most\\nfor the old management company was the party that should manage the shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 money in the future.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite the lapdog behavior of independent fund directors, we did not conclude that they are bad\\npeople.  They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not.  But sadly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboardroom atmosphere\\xe2\\x80\\x9d almost invariably sedates their fiduciary genes.\\n</p>\\n<p>On May 22, 2003, not long after Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report appeared, the Chairman of the Investment\\nCompany Institute addressed its membership about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe State of our Industry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Responding to those who\\nhave \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweighed in about our perceived failings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he mused, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt makes me wonder what life would be like if\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d actually done something wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Be careful what you wish for. \\n</p>\\n<p>Within a few months, the world began to learn that many fund-management companies had\\nfollowed policies that hurt the owners of the funds they managed, while simultaneously boosting the fees of\\nthe managers.  Prior to their transgressions, it should be noted, these management companies were earning\\nprofit margins and returns on tangible equity that were the envy of Corporate America.  Yet to swell profits\\nfurther, they trampled on the interests of fund shareholders in an appalling manner.\\n</p>\\n<p>So what are the directors of these looted funds doing?  As I write this, I have seen none that have\\nterminated the contract of the offending management company (though naturally that entity has often fired\\nsome of its employees).  Can you imagine directors who had been personally defrauded taking such a boys-\\nwill-be-boys attitude?\\n</p>\\n<p>To top it all off, at least one miscreant management company has put itself up for sale,\\nundoubtedly hoping to receive a huge sum for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelivering\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the mutual funds it has managed to the highest\\nbidder among other managers.  This is a travesty.  Why in the world don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the directors of those funds\\nsimply select whomever they think is best among the bidding organizations and sign up with that party\\ndirectly?  The winner would consequently be spared a huge \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpayoff\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the former manager who, having\\nflouted the principles of stewardship, deserves not a dime.  Not having to bear that acquisition cost, the\\nwinner could surely manage the funds in question for a far lower ongoing fee than would otherwise have\\nbeen the case.  Any truly independent director should insist on this approach to obtaining a new manager.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

That is nonsense.  The same\\nrules say that Berkshire director and lawyer Ron Olson, who receives from us perhaps 3% of his very large\\nincome, does not qualify as independent because that 3% comes from legal fees Berkshire pays his firm\\nrather than from fees he earns as a Berkshire director.

A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously despite the\\nopportunities for malfeasance that exist.  The shareholders of these funds have benefited, and their\\nmanagers have earned their pay.  Indeed, if I were a director of certain funds, including some that charge\\nabove-average fees, I would enthusiastically make the two declarations I have suggested.

Hundreds of industry insiders had to know what was going on,\\nyet none publicly said a word.  It took Eliot Spitzer, and the whistleblowers who aided him, to initiate a\\nhousecleaning.

The place to look for it is\\namong high-grade people whose interests are in line with those of rank-and-file shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and are in\\nline in a very big way.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made that search at Berkshire.  We now have eleven directors and each of them, combined\\nwith members of their families, owns more than $4 million of Berkshire stock.  Moreover, all have held\\nmajor stakes in Berkshire for many years.  In the case of six of the eleven, family ownership amounts to at\\nleast hundreds of millions and dates back at least three decades.  All eleven directors purchased their\\nholdings in the market just as you did; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never passed out options or restricted shares.  Charlie and I\\nlove such honest-to-God ownership.  After all, who ever washes a rental car?\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition, director fees at Berkshire are nominal (as my son, Howard, periodically reminds me).\\nThus, the upside from Berkshire for all eleven is proportionately the same as the upside for any Berkshire\\nshareholder.

Therefore, if something really catastrophic happens on our directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nwatch, they are exposed to losses that will far exceed yours. \\n</p>\\n<p>The bottom line for our directors: You win, they win big; you lose, they lose big.  Our approach\\nmight be called owner-capitalism.  We know of no better way to engender true independence.  (This\\nstructure does not guarantee perfect behavior, however: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sat on boards of companies in which Berkshire\\nhad huge stakes and remained silent as questionable proposals were rubber-stamped.)\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition to being independent, directors should have business savvy, a shareholder orientation\\nand a genuine interest in the company.  The rarest of these qualities is business savvy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and if it is lacking,\\nthe other two are of little help.  Many people who are smart, articulate and admired have no real\\nunderstanding of business.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no sin; they may shine elsewhere.  But they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong on corporate\\nboards.  Similarly, I would be useless on a medical or scientific board (though I would likely be welcomed\\nby a chairman who wanted to run things his way).  My name would dress up the list of directors, but I\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know enough to critically evaluate proposals.  Moreover, to cloak my ignorance, I would keep my\\nmouth shut (if you can imagine that).  In effect, I could be replaced, without loss, by a potted plant.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, as we moved to change our board, I asked for self-nominations from shareholders who\\nbelieved they had the requisite qualities to be a Berkshire director.  Despite the lack of either liability\\ninsurance or meaningful compensation, we received more than twenty applications.  Most were good,\\ncoming from owner-oriented individuals having family holdings of Berkshire worth well over $1 million.\\nAfter considering them, Charlie and I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the concurrence of our incumbent directors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 asked four\\nshareholders who did not nominate themselves to join the board: David Gottesman, Charlotte Guyman,\\nDon Keough and Tom Murphy.  These four people are all friends of mine, and I know their strengths well.\\nThey bring an extraordinary amount of business talent to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s board.\\n</p>\\n<p>The primary job of our directors is to select my successor, either upon my death or disability, or\\nwhen I begin to lose my marbles.  (David Ogilvy had it right when he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevelop your eccentricities\\nwhen young.  That way, when you get older, people won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you are going gaga.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family and\\nmine feel that we overreacted to David\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice.) \\n</p>\\n<p>At our directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meetings we cover the usual run of housekeeping matters.  But the real\\ndiscussion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both with me in the room and absent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 centers on the strengths and weaknesses of the four\\ninternal candidates to replace me.  \\n</p>\\n<p>Our board knows that the ultimate scorecard on its performance will be determined by the record\\nof my successor.  He or she will need to maintain Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture, allocate capital and keep a group of\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best managers happy in their jobs.  This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the toughest task in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the train is already\\nmoving at a good clip down the track \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally comfortable about it being done well by any of the\\nfour candidates we have identified.  I have more than 99% of my net worth in Berkshire and will be happy\\nto have my wife or foundation (depending on the order in which she and I die) continue this concentration.\\n</p>\\n<p>Sector Results\\n</p>\\n<p>As managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we\\nwould wish to receive if our roles were reversed.  To do this with both clarity and reasonable brevity\\nbecomes more difficult as Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scope widens.  Some of our businesses have vastly different\\neconomic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated statements, with their jumble of\\nfigures, make useful analysis almost impossible.\\n</p>\\n<p>On the following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from\\nour four major categories of businesses along with commentary about each.  We particularly want you to\\nunderstand the limited circumstances under which we will use debt, since typically we shun it.  We will\\nnot, however, inundate you with data that has no real value in calculating Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value.\\nDoing so would likely obfuscate the most important facts.

Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are\\npaid upfront though the service we provide \\xe2\\x80\\x93 insurance protection \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is delivered over a period that usually\\ncovers a year and; (2) loss events that occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims,\\nsince it sometimes takes years for losses to be reported (think asbestos), negotiated and settled.\\n</p>\\n<p>Float is wonderful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come at a high price.  The cost of float is determined by\\nunderwriting results, meaning how losses and expenses paid compare with premiums received.  The\\nproperty-casualty industry as a whole regularly operates at a substantial underwriting loss, and therefore\\noften has a cost of float that is unattractive.\\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, our results have been good.  True, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had five terrible years in which float cost us\\nmore than 10%.  But in 18 of the 37 years Berkshire has been in the insurance business, we have operated\\nat an underwriting profit, meaning we were actually paid for holding money.

Furthermore, unlike most reinsurers, we retain\\nvirtually all of the risks we assume.  Therefore, our ability to pay is not dependent on the\\nability or willingness of others to reimburse us.

Last year, for example, PepsiCo promoted a drawing\\nthat offered participants a chance to win a $1 billion prize.  Understandably, Pepsi wished to\\nlay off this risk, and we were the logical party to assume it.  So we wrote a $1 billion policy,\\nretaining the risk entirely for our own account.  Because the prize, if won, was payable over\\ntime, our exposure in present-value terms was $250 million.  (I helpfully suggested that any\\nwinner be paid $1 a year for a billion years, but that proposal didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fly.)  The drawing was\\nheld on September 14.

Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some commentary on the most\\nimportant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 I manage a few opportunistic strategies in AAA fixed-income securities that have been quite\\nprofitable in the last few years.  These opportunities come and go \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and at present, they are\\ngoing.  We sped their departure somewhat last year, thereby realizing 24% of the capital gains\\nwe show in the table that follows.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though far from foolproof, these transactions involve no credit risk and are conducted in\\nexceptionally liquid securities.  We therefore finance the positions almost entirely with\\nborrowed money.  As the assets are reduced, so also are the borrowings.  The smaller\\nportfolio we now have means that in the near future our earnings in this category will decline\\nsignificantly.  It was fun while it lasted, and at some point we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get another turn at bat.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 A far less pleasant unwinding operation is taking place at Gen Re Securities, the trading and\\nderivatives operation we inherited when we purchased General Reinsurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>When we began to liquidate Gen Re Securities in early 2002, it had 23,218 outstanding tickets\\nwith 884 counterparties (some having names I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pronounce, much less\\ncreditworthiness I could evaluate).  Since then, the unit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers have been skillful and\\ndiligent in unwinding positions.  Yet, at yearend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nearly two years later \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we still had 7,580\\ntickets outstanding with 453 counterparties.

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had pre-tax losses of $173 million in\\n2002 and $99 million in 2003.  These losses, it should be noted, came from a portfolio of\\ncontracts that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in full compliance with GAAP \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had been regularly marked-to-market with\\nstandard allowances for future credit-loss and administrative costs.  Moreover, our liquidation\\nhas taken place both in a benign market \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had no credit losses of significance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and in\\nan orderly manner.  This is just the opposite of what might be expected if a financial crisis\\nforced a number of derivatives dealers to cease operations simultaneously.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our derivatives experience \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the Freddie Mac shenanigans of mind-blowing size and\\naudacity that were revealed last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 makes you suspicious of accounting in this arena,\\nconsider yourself wised up.  No matter how financially sophisticated you are, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\npossibly learn from reading the disclosure documents of a derivatives-intensive company\\nwhat risks lurk in its positions.

Both Charlie and I knew at the\\ntime of the General Reinsurance merger that its derivatives business was unattractive.\\nReported profits struck us as illusory, and we felt that the business carried sizable risks that\\ncould not effectively be measured or limited.  Moreover, we knew that any major problems\\nthe operation might experience would likely correlate with troubles in the financial or\\ninsurance world that would affect Berkshire elsewhere.  In other words, if the derivatives\\nbusiness were ever to need shoring up, it would commandeer the capital and credit of\\nBerkshire at just the time we could otherwise deploy those resources to huge advantage.  (A\\nhistorical note: We had just such an experience in 1974 when we were the victim of a major\\ninsurance fraud.  We could not determine for some time how much the fraud would ultimately\\ncost us and therefore kept more funds in cash-equivalents than we normally would have. </p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

As a consequence, our shareholders are paying a far higher price than\\nwas necessary to exit this business.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Though we include Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sizable life and health reinsurance business in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinsurance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nsector, we show the results for Ajit Jain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life and annuity business in this section.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbecause this business, in large part, involves arbitraging money.  Our annuities range from a\\nretail product sold directly on the Internet to structured settlements that require us to make\\npayments for 70 years or more to people severely injured in accidents.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve realized some extra income in this business because of accelerated principal payments\\nwe received from certain fixed-income securities we had purchased at discounts.  This\\nphenomenon has ended, and earnings are therefore likely to be lower in this segment during\\nthe next few years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We have a $604 million investment in Value Capital, a partnership run by Mark Byrne, a\\nmember of a family that has helped Berkshire over the years in many ways.  Berkshire is a\\nlimited partner in, and has no say in the management of, Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enterprise, which specializes\\nin highly-hedged fixed-income opportunities.  Mark is smart and honest and, along with his\\nfamily, has a significant investment in Value.\\n</p>\\n<p>Because of accounting abuses at Enron and elsewhere, rules will soon be instituted that are\\nlikely to require that Value\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets and liabilities be consolidated on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s balance\\nsheet.  We regard this requirement as inappropriate, given that Value\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liabilities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which\\nusually are above $20 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are in no way ours.  Over time, other investors will join us as\\npartners in Value.  When enough do, the need for us to consolidate Value will disappear.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We have told you in the past about Berkadia, the partnership we formed three years ago with\\nLeucadia to finance and manage the wind-down of Finova, a bankrupt lending operation.  The\\nplan was that we would supply most of the capital and Leucadia would supply most of the\\nbrains.  And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it has worked.  Indeed, Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming, who\\ntogether run Leucadia, have done such a fine job in liquidating Finova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio that the $5.6\\nbillion guarantee we took on in connection with the transaction has been extinguished.  The\\nunfortunate byproduct of this fast payoff is that our future income will be much reduced.\\nOverall, Berkadia has made excellent money for us, and Joe and Ian have been terrific\\npartners.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Our leasing businesses are XTRA (transportation equipment) and CORT (office furniture).\\nBoth operations have had poor earnings during the past two years as the recession caused\\ndemand to drop considerably more than was anticipated.  They remain leaders in their fields,\\nand I expect at least a modest improvement in their earnings this year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Through our Clayton purchase, we acquired a significant manufactured-housing finance\\noperation.  Clayton, like others in this business, had traditionally securitized the loans it\\noriginated.  The practice relieved stress on Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s balance sheet, but a by-product was the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfront-ending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of income (a result dictated by GAAP).\\n</p>\\n<p>We are in no hurry to record income, have enormous balance-sheet strength, and believe that\\nover the long-term the economics of holding our consumer paper are superior to what we can\\nnow realize through securitization.  So Clayton has begun to retain its loans.\\n</p>\\n<p>We believe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appropriate to finance a soundly-selected book of interest-bearing receivables\\nalmost entirely with debt (just as a bank would).  Therefore, Berkshire will borrow money to\\nfinance Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio and re-lend these funds to Clayton at our cost plus one percentage</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>17\\n</p>\\n<p>point.  This markup fairly compensates Berkshire for putting its exceptional creditworthiness\\nto work, but it still delivers money to Clayton at an attractive price.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2003, Berkshire did $2 billion of such borrowing and re-lending, with Clayton using much\\nof this money to fund several large purchases of portfolios from lenders exiting the business.\\nA portion of our loans to Clayton also provided \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccatch-up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d funding for paper it had generated\\nearlier in the year from its own operation and had found difficult to securitize.\\n</p>\\n<p>You may wonder why we borrow money while sitting on a mountain of cash.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of\\nour \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevery tub on its own bottom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d philosophy.  We believe that any subsidiary lending money\\nshould pay an appropriate rate for the funds needed to carry its receivables and should not be\\nsubsidized by its parent.  Otherwise, having a rich daddy can lead to sloppy decisions.\\nMeanwhile, the cash we accumulate at Berkshire is destined for business acquisitions or for\\nthe purchase of securities that offer opportunities for significant profit.  Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan\\nportfolio will likely grow to at least $5 billion in not too many years and, with sensible credit\\nstandards in place, should deliver significant earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>For simplicity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, we include all of Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings in this sector, though a sizable\\nportion is derived from areas other than consumer finance.\\n</p>\\n<p>(in $ millions)\\nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-bearing Liabilities\\n</p>\\n<p>2003 2002 2003 2002\\nTrading  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ordinary Income ........................... $  379 $  553 $7,826 $13,762\\nGen Re Securities ...........................................

(The abnormals: In 2002 we had a $60 million pre-tax\\ngain from the sale of a partnership interest to Boeing, and in 2003 we recognized a $37 million loss\\nstemming from the premature obsolescence of simulators.)  The corporate aviation business has slowed\\nsignificantly in the past few years, and this fact has hurt FlightSafety\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results.  The company\\ncontinues, however, to be far and away the leader in its field.  Its simulators have an original cost of\\n$1.2 billion, which is more than triple the cost of those operated by our closest competitor.\\n</p>\\n<p>NetJets, our fractional-ownership operation lost $41 million pre-tax in 2003.  The company had a\\nmodest operating profit in the U.S., but this was more than offset by a $32 million loss on aircraft\\ninventory and by continued losses in Europe.\\n</p>\\n<p>NetJets continues to dominate the fractional-ownership field, and its lead is increasing: Prospects\\noverwhelmingly turn to us rather than to our three major competitors.  Last year, among the four of us,\\nwe accounted for 70% of net sales (measured by value).\\n</p>\\n<p>An example of what sets NetJets apart from competitors is our Mayo Clinic Executive Travel\\nResponse program, a free benefit enjoyed by all of our owners.  On land or in the air, anywhere in the\\nworld and at any hour of any day, our owners and their families have an immediate link to Mayo.\\nShould an emergency occur while they are traveling here or abroad, Mayo will instantly direct them to\\nan appropriate doctor or hospital.  Any baseline data about the patient that Mayo possesses is\\nsimultaneously made available to the treating physician.  Many owners have already found this service\\ninvaluable, including one who needed emergency brain surgery in Eastern Europe.\\n</p>\\n<p>The $32 million inventory write-down we took in 2003 occurred because of falling prices for used\\naircraft early in the year.  Specifically, we bought back fractions from withdrawing owners at\\nprevailing prices, and these fell in value before we were able to remarket them.  Prices are now stable.\\n</p>\\n<p>The European loss is painful.  But any company that forsakes Europe, as all of our competitors have\\ndone, is destined for second-tier status.  Many of our U.S. owners fly extensively in Europe and want\\nthe safety and security assured by a NetJets plane and pilots.  Despite a slow start, furthermore, we are\\nnow adding European customers at a good pace.  During the years 2001 through 2003, we had gains of\\n88%, 61% and 77% in European management-and-flying revenues.

But Berkshire holds many billions of cash-equivalents\\ndenominated in dollars.  So I feel more comfortable owning foreign-exchange contracts that are at least a\\npartial offset to that position.\\n</p>\\n<p>These contracts are subject to accounting rules that require changes in their value to be\\ncontemporaneously included in capital gains or losses, even though the contracts have not been closed.  We\\nshow these changes each quarter in the Finance and Financial Products segment of our earnings statement.\\nAt yearend, our open foreign exchange contracts totaled about $12 billion at market values and were spread\\namong five currencies.

We were the only major public company that offered such a program\\nto shareholders, and Charlie and I were proud of it.\\n</p>\\n<p>We reluctantly terminated the program in 2003 because of controversy over the abortion issue.\\nOver the years numerous organizations on both sides of this issue had been designated by our shareholders\\nto receive contributions.  As a result, we regularly received some objections to the gifts designated for pro-\\nchoice operations.  A few of these came from people and organizations that proceeded to boycott products</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '21': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>22\\n</p>\\n<p>of our subsidiaries.  That did not concern us.  We refused all requests to limit the right of our owners to\\nmake whatever gifts they chose (as long as the recipients had 501(c)(3) status).\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2003, however, many independent associates of The Pampered Chef began to feel the boycotts.\\nThis development meant that people who trusted us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but who were neither employees of ours nor had a\\nvoice in Berkshire decision-making \\xe2\\x80\\x93 suffered serious losses of income.\\n</p>\\n<p>For our shareholders, there was some modest tax efficiency in Berkshire doing the giving rather\\nthan their making their gifts directly.  Additionally, the program was consistent with our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartnership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\napproach, the first principle set forth in our Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\n \\n \\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\n \\n Our gain in net worth during 2004 was $8.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 10.5%.  Over the last 40 years (that is, since present management \\ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $55,824, a rate of 21.9% compounded annually.* \\n \\n It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic value that counts, however, not book value.  Here, the news is good: \\nBetween 1964 and 2004, Berkshire morphed from a struggling northern textile business whose intrinsic \\nvalue was less than book into a diversified enterprise worth far more than book.  Our 40-year gain in \\nintrinsic value has therefore somewhat exceeded our 21.9% gain in book.  (For an explanation of intrinsic \\nvalue and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice-chairman, \\nand me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual, beginning on page 73.) \\n \\n Despite their shortcomings, yearly calculations of book value are useful at Berkshire as a slightly \\nunderstated gauge for measuring the long-term rate of increase in our intrinsic value.  The calculations are \\nless relevant, however, than they once were in rating any single year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance versus the S&amp;P 500 \\nindex (a comparison we display on the facing page).  Our equity holdings (including convertible preferreds) \\nhave fallen considerably as a percentage of our net worth, from an average of 114% in the 1980s, for \\nexample, to less than 50% in recent years.  Therefore, yearly movements in the stock market now affect a \\nmuch smaller portion of our net worth than was once the case, a fact that will normally cause us to \\nunderperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform in years when they fall. \\n \\n However the yearly comparisons work out, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term performance versus the S&amp;P \\nremains all-important.  Our shareholders can buy the S&amp;P through an index fund at very low cost.  Unless \\nwe achieve gains in per-share intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&amp;P, Charlie and I will be adding \\nnothing to what you can accomplish on your own. \\n \\n Last year, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book-value gain of 10.5% fell short of the index\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 10.9% return.  Our \\nlackluster performance was not due to any stumbles by the CEOs of our operating businesses: As always, \\nthey pulled more than their share of the load.  My message to them is simple: Run your business as if it \\nwere the only asset your family will own over the next hundred years.  Almost invariably they do just that \\nand, after taking care of the needs of their business, send excess cash to Omaha for me to deploy. \\n \\n I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that job very well last year.  My hope was to make several multi-billion dollar \\nacquisitions that would add new and significant streams of earnings to the many we already have.  But I \\nstruck out.  Additionally, I found very few attractive securities to buy.  Berkshire therefore ended the year \\nwith $43 billion of cash equivalents, not a happy position.  Charlie and I will work to translate some of this \\nhoard into more interesting assets during 2005, though we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t promise success. \\n \\n In one respect, 2004 was a remarkable year for the stock market, a fact buried in the maze of \\nnumbers on page 2.  If you examine the 35 years since the 1960s ended, you will find that an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nreturn, including dividends, from owning the S&amp;P has averaged 11.2% annually (well above what we \\nexpect future returns to be). But if you look for years with returns anywhere close to that 11.2% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 say, \\nbetween 8% and 14% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you will find only one before 2004.  In other words, last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d return is \\nanything but. \\n \\n \\n  \\n *All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares, the successor to the only stock that \\nthe company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of \\nthe A. \\n</p>\\n<p> 3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Over the 35 years, American business has delivered terrific results.  It should therefore have been \\neasy for investors to earn juicy returns: All they had to do was piggyback Corporate America in a \\ndiversified, low-expense way.  An index fund that they never touched would have done the job.  Instead \\nmany investors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous. \\n \\n There have been three primary causes: first, high costs, usually because investors traded \\nexcessively or spent far too much on investment management; second, portfolio decisions based on tips and \\nfads rather than on thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses; and third, a start-and-stop approach to \\nthe market marked by untimely entries (after an advance has been long underway) and exits (after periods \\nof stagnation or decline).  Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies.  And \\nif they insist on trying to time their participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are \\ngreedy and greedy only when others are fearful. \\n \\nSector Results \\n \\n As managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we \\nwould wish to receive if our roles were reversed.  To do this with both clarity and reasonable brevity \\nbecomes more difficult as Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scope widens.  Some of our businesses have vastly different \\neconomic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated statements, with their jumble of \\nfigures, make useful analysis almost impossible. \\n \\n On the following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from \\nour four major categories of businesses along with commentary about each.  We particularly want you to \\nunderstand the limited circumstances under which we will use debt, given that we typically shun it.  We \\nwill not, however, inundate you with data that has no real value in estimating Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value.  \\nDoing so would tend to obfuscate the facts that count. \\n \\nRegulated Utility Businesses \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>  We have an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide \\nvariety of utility operations.  The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose \\n3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) \\nMidAmerican Energy, which serves 698,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; and (3) Kern River and \\nNorthern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.9% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  The remaining 19.5% of MidAmerican is owned by three partners of ours:  Dave Sokol and Greg \\n</p>\\n<p>Abel, the brilliant managers of these businesses, and Walter Scott, a long-time friend of mine who \\nintroduced me to the company.  Because MidAmerican is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company \\nAct (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPUHCA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voting interest is limited to 9.9%.  Voting control rests with Walter. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  Our limited voting interest forces us to account for MidAmerican in an abbreviated manner.  \\n</p>\\n<p>Instead of our fully incorporating the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nstatements, we make one-line entries only in both our balance sheet and income account.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely, \\nthough, that PUHCA will someday \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps soon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 be repealed or that accounting rules will change.  \\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consolidated figures would then incorporate all of MidAmerican, including the substantial debt \\nit utilizes (though this debt is not now, nor will it ever be, an obligation of Berkshire). \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  At yearend, $1.478 billion of MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s junior debt was payable to Berkshire.  This debt has \\n</p>\\n<p>allowed acquisitions to be financed without our partners needing to increase their already substantial \\ninvestments in MidAmerican.  By charging 11% interest, Berkshire is compensated fairly for putting up the \\nfunds needed for purchases, while our partners are spared dilution of their equity interests.  Because \\nMidAmerican made no large acquisitions last year, it paid down $100 million of what it owes us. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n<p> 4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>  MidAmerican also owns a significant non-utility business, HomeServices of America, the second \\nlargest real estate broker in the country.  Unlike our utility operations, this business is highly cyclical, but \\nnevertheless one we view enthusiastically.  We have an exceptional manager, Ron Peltier, who through \\nboth his acquisition and operational skills is building a brokerage powerhouse. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  HomeServices participated in $59.8 billion of transactions in 2004, a gain of $11.2 billion from \\n</p>\\n<p>2003.  About 24% of the increase came from six acquisitions made during the year.  Through our 17 \\nbrokerage firms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of which retain their local identities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we employ more than 18,000 brokers in 18 \\nstates.  HomeServices is almost certain to grow substantially in the next decade as we continue to acquire \\nleading localized operations. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  Last year MidAmerican wrote off a major investment in a zinc recovery project that was initiated \\n</p>\\n<p>in 1998 and became operational in 2002.  Large quantities of zinc are present in the brine produced by our \\nCalifornia geothermal operations, and we believed we could profitably extract the metal.  For many \\nmonths, it appeared that commercially-viable recoveries were imminent.  But in mining, just as in oil \\nexploration, prospects have a way of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cteasing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their developers, and every time one problem was solved, \\nanother popped up.  In September, we threw in the towel. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  Our failure here illustrates the importance of a guideline \\xe2\\x80\\x93 stay with simple propositions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we \\n</p>\\n<p>usually apply in investments as well as operations.  If only one variable is key to a decision, and the \\nvariable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90%.  But \\nif ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% probability \\nof success, the likelihood of having a winner is only 35%.  In our zinc venture, we solved most of the \\nproblems.  But one proved intractable, and that was one too many.  Since a chain is no stronger than its \\nweakest link, it makes sense to look for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll excuse an oxymoron \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mono-linked chains. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  A breakdown of MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results follows.

       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Insurance \\n \\n Since Berkshire purchased National Indemnity (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNICO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in 1967, property-casualty insurance has \\nbeen our core business and the propellant of our growth.  Insurance has provided a fountain of funds with \\nwhich we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve acquired the securities and businesses that now give us an ever-widening variety of earnings \\nstreams.  So in this section, I will be spending a little time telling you how we got where we are. \\n \\n The source of our insurance funds is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is money that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to us but that we \\ntemporarily hold.  Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we \\nprovide \\xe2\\x80\\x93 insurance protection \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events \\nthat occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many \\nyears for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled.  The $20 \\nmillion of float that came with our 1967 purchase has now increased \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both by way of internal growth and \\nacquisitions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to $46.1 billion. \\n \\n Float is wonderful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come at a high price.  Its cost is determined by underwriting \\nresults, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have \\nreceived.  When an underwriting profit is achieved \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of the \\n38 years we have been in the insurance business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 float is better than free.  In such years, we are actually \\npaid for holding other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money.  For most insurers, however, life has been far more difficult: In \\naggregate, the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss.  When that \\nloss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so. \\n \\n Insurers have generally earned poor returns for a simple reason: They sell a commodity-like \\nproduct.  Policy forms are standard, and the product is available from many suppliers, some of whom are \\nmutual companies (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cowned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by policyholders rather than stockholders) with profit goals that are limited.  \\nMoreover, most insureds don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care from whom they buy.  Customers by the millions say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI need some \\nGillette blades\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a Coke\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but we wait in vain for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a National Indemnity policy, please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\nConsequently, price competition in insurance is usually fierce.  Think airline seats. \\n \\n So, you may ask, how do Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance operations overcome the dismal economics of the \\nindustry and achieve some measure of enduring competitive advantage?  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve attacked that problem in \\nseveral ways.  Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at NICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy. \\n \\n When we purchased the company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a specialist in commercial auto and general liability insurance \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 it did not appear to have any attributes that would overcome the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chronic troubles.  It was not \\nwell-known, had no informational advantage (the company has never had an actuary), was not a low-cost \\noperator, and sold through general agents, a method many people thought outdated.  Nevertheless, for \\nalmost all of the past 38 years, NICO has been a star performer.  Indeed, had we not made this acquisition, \\nBerkshire would be lucky to be worth half of what it is today. \\n \\n What we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had going for us is a managerial mindset that most insurers find impossible to \\nreplicate.  Take a look at the facing page.  Can you imagine any public company embracing a business \\nmodel that would lead to the decline in revenue that we experienced from 1986 through 1999?  That \\ncolossal slide, it should be emphasized, did not occur because business was unobtainable.  Many billions of \\npremium dollars were readily available to NICO had we only been willing to cut prices.  But we instead \\nconsistently priced to make a profit, not to match our most optimistic competitor.  We never left customers \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they left us. \\n \\n Most American businesses harbor an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinstitutional imperative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that rejects extended decreases in \\nvolume.  What CEO wants to report to his shareholders that not only did business contract last year but that \\nit will continue to drop?  In insurance, the urge to keep writing business is also intensified because the \\nconsequences of foolishly-priced policies may not become apparent for some time.  If an insurer is \\noptimistic in its reserving, reported earnings will be overstated, and years may pass before true loss costs \\nare revealed (a form of self-deception that nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 1970s). \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Finally, there is a fear factor at work, in that a shrinking business usually leads to layoffs.  To \\navoid pink slips, employees will rationalize inadequate pricing, telling themselves that poorly-priced \\nbusiness must be tolerated in order to keep the organization intact and the distribution system happy.  If this \\ncourse isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t followed, these employees will argue, the company will not participate in the recovery that \\nthey invariably feel is just around the corner. \\n \\n To combat employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 natural tendency to save their own skins, we have always promised \\nNICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workforce that no one will be fired because of declining volume, however severe the contraction.  \\n(This is not Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of place.)  NICO is not labor-intensive, and, as the table suggests, can live \\nwith excess overhead.  It can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live, however, with underpriced business and the breakdown in underwriting \\ndiscipline that accompanies it.  An insurance organization that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care deeply about underwriting at a \\nprofit this year is unlikely to care next year either. \\n \\n Naturally, a business that follows a no-layoff policy must be especially careful to avoid \\noverstaffing when times are good.  Thirty years ago Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, drove this point \\nhome to me with a hypothetical tale about an employee who asked his boss for permission to hire an \\nassistant.  The employee assumed that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential.  But \\nhis boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3 million decision, given that an additional person \\nwould probably cost at least that amount over his lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits and other expenses \\n(more people, more toilet paper).  And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added \\nwould be unlikely to be dismissed, however marginal his contribution to the business. \\n \\n It takes real fortitude \\xe2\\x80\\x93 embedded deep within a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to operate as NICO does.  \\nAnyone examining the table can scan the years from 1986 to 1999 quickly.  But living day after day with \\ndwindling volume \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while competitors are boasting of growth and reaping Wall Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s applause \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is an \\nexperience few managers can tolerate.  NICO, however, has had four CEOs since its formation in 1940 and \\nnone have bent.  (It should be noted that only one of the four graduated from college.  Our experience tells \\nus that extraordinary business ability is largely innate.) \\n \\n The current managerial star \\xe2\\x80\\x93 make that superstar \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at NICO is Don Wurster (yes, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe \\ngraduate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), who has been running things since 1989.  His slugging percentage is right up there with Barry \\nBonds\\xe2\\x80\\x99 because, like Barry, Don will accept a walk rather than swing at a bad pitch.  Don has now amassed \\n$950 million of float at NICO that over time is almost certain to be proved the negative-cost kind.  Because \\ninsurance prices are falling, Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99s volume will soon decline very significantly and, as it does, Charlie and I \\nwill applaud him ever more loudly. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Another way to prosper in a commodity-type business is to be the low-cost operator.  Among auto \\ninsurers operating on a broad scale, GEICO holds that cherished title.  For NICO, as we have seen, an ebb-\\nand-flow business model makes sense.  But a company holding a low-cost advantage must pursue an \\nunrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy.  And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just what we do at GEICO. \\n \\n A century ago, when autos first appeared, the property-casualty industry operated as a cartel.  The \\nmajor companies, most of which were based in the Northeast, established \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbureau\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rates and that was it.  \\nNo one cut prices to attract business.  Instead, insurers competed for strong, well-regarded agents, a focus \\nthat produced high commissions for agents and high prices for consumers. \\n \\n In 1922, State Farm was formed by George Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, who aimed to \\ntake advantage of the pricing umbrella maintained by the high-cost giants of the industry.  State Farm \\nemployed a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccaptive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agency force, a system keeping its acquisition costs lower than those incurred by the \\nbureau insurers (whose \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agents successfully played off one company against another).  With \\nits low-cost structure, State Farm eventually captured about 25% of the personal lines (auto and \\nhomeowners) business, far outdistancing its once-mighty competitors.  Allstate, formed in 1931, put a \\nsimilar distribution system into place and soon became the runner-up in personal lines to State Farm.  \\nCapitalism had worked its magic, and these low-cost operations looked unstoppable. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> But a man named Leo Goodwin had an idea for an even more efficient auto insurer and, with a \\nskimpy $200,000, started GEICO in 1936.  Goodwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan was to eliminate the agent entirely and to deal \\ninstead directly with the auto owner.  Why, he asked himself, should there be any unnecessary and \\nexpensive links in the distribution mechanism when the product, auto insurance, was both mandatory and \\ncostly.  Purchasers of business insurance, he reasoned, might well require professional advice, but most \\nconsumers knew what they needed in an auto policy.  That was a powerful insight. \\n \\n Originally, GEICO mailed its low-cost message to a limited audience of government employees.  \\nLater, it widened its horizons and shifted its marketing emphasis to the phone, working inquiries that came \\nfrom broadcast and print advertising.  And today the Internet is coming on strong. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Between 1936 and 1975, GEICO grew from a standing start to a 4% market share, becoming the \\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth largest auto insurer.  During most of this period, the company was superbly managed, \\nachieving both excellent volume gains and high profits.  It looked unstoppable.  But after my friend and \\nhero Lorimer Davidson retired as CEO in 1970, his successors soon made a huge mistake by under-\\nreserving for losses.  This produced faulty cost information, which in turn produced inadequate pricing.  By \\n1976, GEICO was on the brink of failure. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Jack Byrne then joined GEICO as CEO and, almost single-handedly, saved the company by heroic \\nefforts that included major price increases.  Though GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survival required these, policyholders fled \\nthe company, and by 1980 its market share had fallen to 1.8%.  Subsequently, the company embarked on \\nsome unwise diversification moves.  This shift of emphasis away from its extraordinary core business \\nstunted GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth, and by 1993 its market share had grown only fractionally, to 1.9%.  Then Tony \\nNicely took charge. \\n \\n And what a difference that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made: In 2005 GEICO will probably secure a 6% market share.  \\nBetter yet, Tony has matched growth with profitability.  Indeed, GEICO delivers all of its constituents \\nmajor benefits: In 2004 its customers saved $1 billion or so compared to what they would otherwise have \\npaid for coverage, its associates earned a $191 million profit-sharing bonus that averaged 24.3% of salary, \\nand its owner \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 enjoyed excellent financial returns. \\n \\n There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more good news.  When Jack Byrne was rescuing the company in 1976, New Jersey \\nrefused to grant him the rates he needed to operate profitably.  He therefore promptly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and properly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nwithdrew from the state.  Subsequently, GEICO avoided both New Jersey and Massachusetts, recognizing \\nthem as two jurisdictions in which insurers were destined to struggle. \\n \\n In 2003, however, New Jersey took a new look at its chronic auto-insurance problems and enacted \\nlegislation that would curb fraud and allow insurers a fair playing field.  Even so, one might have expected \\nthe state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bureaucracy to make change slow and difficult. \\n \\n But just the opposite occurred.  Holly Bakke, the New Jersey insurance commissioner, who would \\nbe a success in any line of work, was determined to turn the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intent into reality.  With her staff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\ncooperation, GEICO ironed out the details for re-entering the state and was licensed last August. Since \\nthen, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received a response from New Jersey drivers that is multiples of my expectations. \\n \\n We are now serving 140,000 policyholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about 4% of the New Jersey market \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and saving \\nthem substantial sums (as we do drivers everywhere).  Word-of-mouth recommendations within the state \\nare causing inquiries to pour in.  And once we hear from a New Jersey prospect, our closure rate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the \\npercentage of policies issued to inquiries received \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is far higher in the state than it is nationally. \\n \\n We make no claim, of course, that we can save everyone money.  Some companies, using rating \\nsystems that are different from ours, will offer certain classes of drivers a lower rate than we do.  But we \\nbelieve GEICO offers the lowest price more often than any other national company that serves all segments \\nof the public.  In addition, in most states, including New Jersey, Berkshire shareholders receive an 8% \\ndiscount.

At bottom, any insurance policy is simply a promise, and \\nas everyone knows, promises vary enormously in their quality. \\n \\n At the primary insurance level, nevertheless, just who makes the promise is often of minor \\nimportance.  In personal-lines insurance, for example, states levy assessments on solvent companies to pay \\nthe policyholders of companies that go broke.  In the business-insurance field, the same arrangement \\napplies to workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation policies.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProtected\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policies of these types account for about 60% of \\nthe property-casualty industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s volume.  Prudently-run insurers are irritated by the need to subsidize poor \\nor reckless management elsewhere, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it is. \\n \\n Other forms of business insurance at the primary level involve promises that carry greater risks for \\nthe insured.  When Reliance Insurance and Home Insurance were run into the ground, for example, their \\npromises proved to be worthless.  Consequently, many holders of their business policies (other than those \\ncovering workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation) suffered painful losses. \\n \\n The solvency risk in primary policies, however, pales in comparison to that lurking in reinsurance \\npolicies.  When a reinsurer goes broke, staggering losses almost always strike the primary companies it has \\ndealt with.  This risk is far from minor: GEICO has suffered tens of millions in losses from its careless \\nselection of reinsurers in the early 1980s. \\n \\n Were a true mega-catastrophe to occur in the next decade or two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real possibility \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nsome reinsurers would not survive.  The largest insured loss to date is the World Trade Center disaster, \\nwhich cost the insurance industry an estimated $35 billion.  Hurricane Andrew cost insurers about $15.5 \\nbillion in 1992 (though that loss would be far higher in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dollars).  Both events rocked the insurance \\nand reinsurance world.  But a $100 billion event, or even a larger catastrophe, remains a possibility if either \\na particularly severe earthquake or hurricane hits just the wrong place.  Four significant hurricanes struck \\nFlorida during 2004, causing an aggregate of $25 billion or so in insured losses.  Two of these \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Charley \\nand Ivan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 could have done at least three times the damage they did had they entered the U.S. not far from \\ntheir actual landing points. \\n \\n Many insurers regard a $100 billion industry loss as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunthinkable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even plan for it.  But \\nat Berkshire, we are fully prepared.  Our share of the loss would probably be 3% to 5%, and earnings from \\nour investments and other businesses would comfortably exceed that cost.

Nevertheless, absent a mega-catastrophe, \\nwe have a decent chance of achieving no-cost float again this year. \\n \\nFinance and Finance Products \\n \\n Last year in this section we discussed a potpourri of activities.  In this report, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll skip over \\nseveral that are now of lesser importance:  Berkadia is down to tag ends; Value Capital has added other \\ninvestors, negating our expectation that we would need to consolidate its financials into ours; and the \\ntrading operation that I run continues to shrink. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Both of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leasing operations rebounded last year.  At CORT (office furniture), earnings \\nremain inadequate, but are trending upward.  XTRA disposed of its container and intermodal \\nbusinesses in order to concentrate on trailer leasing, long its strong suit.  Overhead has been \\nreduced, asset utilization is up and decent profits are now being achieved under Bill Franz, the \\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new CEO. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The wind-down of Gen Re Securities continues.  We decided to exit this derivative operation three \\n</p>\\n<p>years ago, but getting out is easier said than done.  Though derivative instruments are purported to \\nbe highly liquid \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and though we have had the benefit of a benign market while liquidating ours \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nwe still had 2,890 contracts outstanding at yearend, down from 23,218 at the peak.  Like Hell, \\nderivative trading is easy to enter but difficult to leave.  (Other similarities come to mind as well.) \\n \\nGen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s derivative contracts have always been required to be marked to market, and I believe the \\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management conscientiously tried to make realistic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The market prices of \\nderivatives, however, can be very fuzzy in a world in which settlement of a transaction is \\nsometimes decades away and often involves multiple variables as well.  In the interim the marks \\ninfluence the managerial and trading bonuses that are paid annually.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small wonder that \\nphantom profits are often recorded. \\n \\nInvestors should understand that in all types of financial institutions, rapid growth sometimes \\nmasks major underlying problems (and occasionally fraud).  The real test of the earning power of \\na derivatives operation is what it achieves after operating for an extended period in a no-growth \\nmode.  You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 After 40 years, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve finally generated a little synergy at Berkshire: Clayton Homes is doing well \\nand that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in part due to its association with Berkshire.

Volume in these years was the lowest since \\n1962, and it was also only about 40% of annual sales during the years 1995-99.  That era, \\ncharacterized by irresponsible financing and na\\xc3\\xafve funders, was a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paradise for the industry.  \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nBecause one major lender after another has fled the field, financing continues to bedevil \\nmanufacturers, retailers and purchasers of manufactured homes.  Here Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support has \\nproven valuable to Clayton.  We stand ready to fund whatever makes sense, and last year \\nClayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management found much that qualified. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nAs we explained in our 2003 report, we believe in using borrowed money to support profitable, \\ninterest-bearing receivables.  At the beginning of last year, we had borrowed $2 billion to relend to \\nClayton (at a one percentage-point markup) and by January 2005 the total was $7.35 billion.  Most \\nof the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4, 2005, to finance a seasoned portfolio that \\nClayton purchased on December 30, 2004 from a bank exiting the business. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nWe now have two additional portfolio purchases in the works, totaling about $1.6 billion, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nquite unlikely that we will secure others of any significance.  Therefore, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receivables (in \\nwhich originations will roughly offset payoffs) will probably hover around $9 billion for some \\ntime and should deliver steady earnings.  This pattern will be far different from that of the past, in \\nwhich Clayton, like all major players in its industry, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecuritized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d its receivables, causing earnings \\nto be front-ended.  In the last two years, the securitization market has dried up.  The limited funds \\navailable today come only at higher cost and with harsh terms.  Had Clayton remained \\nindependent in this period, it would have had mediocre earnings as it struggled with financing. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nIn April, Clayton completed the acquisition of Oakwood Homes and is now the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest \\nproducer and retailer of manufactured homes.  We love putting more assets in the hands of Kevin \\nClayton, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO.  He is a prototype Berkshire manager.  Today, Clayton has 11,837 \\nemployees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased that Berkshire has \\nbeen useful in facilitating this growth. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nFor simplicity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, we include all of Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings in this sector, though a sizable portion \\nof these are derived from areas other than consumer finance. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n(in $ millions) \\n</p>\\n<p>Pre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities \\n 2004 2003 2004 2003 \\nTrading  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ordinary income ............................  $   264 $   355 $5,751 $7,826 \\nGen Re Securities ...........................................

Additionally, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profit margin widened.  Last year was not a fluke: \\nDuring the past decade, the same-store sales gains of the company have averaged 8.8%. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Ed and Jon Bridge are fourth-generation managers and run the business exactly as if it were their own \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x93 which it is in every respect except for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name on the stock certificates.

Willey, the gains from expansion have been even more dramatic, with 41.9% of \\n2004 sales coming from out-of-state stores that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist before 1999.  The company also improved \\nits profit margin in 2004, propelled by its two new stores in Las Vegas. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n I would like to tell you that these stores were my idea.  In truth, I thought they were mistakes.  I knew, \\n</p>\\n<p>of course, how brilliantly Bill Child had run the R. C. Willey operation in Utah, where its market share \\nhad long been huge.  But I felt our closed-on-Sunday policy would prove disastrous away from home.  \\nEven our first out-of-state store in Boise, which was highly successful, left me unconvinced.  I kept \\nasking whether Las Vegas residents, conditioned to seven-day-a-week retailers, would adjust to us. \\nOur first Las Vegas store, opened in 2001, answered this question in a resounding manner, \\nimmediately becoming our number one unit. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Bill and Scott Hymas, his successor as CEO, then proposed a second Las Vegas store, only about 20 \\n</p>\\n<p>minutes away.  I felt this expansion would cannibalize the first unit, adding significant costs but only \\nmodest sales.  The result? Each store is now doing about 26% more volume than any other store in the \\nchain and is consistently showing large year-over-year gains. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n R. C. Willey will soon open in Reno.  Before making this commitment, Bill and Scott again asked for \\n</p>\\n<p>my advice.  Initially, I was pretty puffed up about the fact that they were consulting me.  But then it \\ndawned on me that the opinion of someone who is always wrong has its own special utility to decision-\\nmakers. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n<p> 14</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Earnings improved in flight services.  At FlightSafety, the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leader in pilot training, profits rose \\nas corporate aviation rebounded and our business with regional airlines increased.  We now operate \\n283 simulators with an original cost of $1.2 billion.  Pilots are trained one at a time on this expensive \\nequipment.  This means that as much as $3.50 of capital investment is required to produce $1 of annual \\nrevenue.  With this level of capital intensity, FlightSafety requires very high operating margins in order \\nto obtain reasonable returns on capital, which means that utilization rates are all-important.  Last year, \\nFlightSafety\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return on tangible equity improved to 15.1% from 8.4% in 2003. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nIn another 2004 event, Al Ueltschi, who founded FlightSafety in 1951 with $10,000, turned over the \\nCEO position to Bruce Whitman, a 43-year veteran at the company.  (But Al\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going anywhere; I \\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let him.)  Bruce shares Al\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conviction that flying an aircraft is a privilege to be extended only to \\npeople who regularly receive the highest quality of training and are undeniably competent.  A few \\nyears ago, Charlie was asked to intervene with Al on behalf of a tycoon friend whom FlightSafety had \\nflunked.  Al\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply to Charlie: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell your pal he belongs in the back of the plane, not the cockpit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nFlightSafety\\xe2\\x80\\x99s number one customer is NetJets, our aircraft fractional-ownership subsidiary.  Its 2,100 \\npilots spend an average of 18 days a year in training.  Additionally, these pilots fly only one aircraft \\ntype whereas many flight operations juggle pilots among several types.  NetJets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 high standards on \\nboth fronts are two of the reasons I signed up with the company years before Berkshire bought it. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Fully as important in my decisions to both use and buy NetJets, however, was the fact that the \\n</p>\\n<p>company was managed by Rich Santulli, the creator of the fractional-ownership industry and a fanatic \\nabout safety and service.  I viewed the selection of a flight provider as akin to picking a brain surgeon: \\nyou simply want the best.  (Let someone else experiment with the low bidder.) \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Last year NetJets again gained about 70% of the net new business (measured by dollar value) going to \\n</p>\\n<p>the four companies that dominate the industry.  A portion of our growth came from the 25-hour card \\noffered by Marquis Jet Partners.  Marquis is not owned by NetJets, but is instead a customer that \\nrepackages the purchases it makes from us into smaller packages that it sells through its card.  Marquis \\ndeals exclusively with NetJets, utilizing the power of our reputation in its marketing. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Our U.S. contracts, including Marquis customers, grew from 3,877 to 4,967 in 2004 (versus \\n</p>\\n<p>approximately 1,200 contracts when Berkshire bought NetJets in 1998).  Some clients (including me) \\nenter into multiple contracts because they wish to use more than one type of aircraft, selecting for any \\ngiven trip whichever type best fits the mission at hand. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n NetJets earned a modest amount in the U.S. last year.  But what we earned domestically was largely \\n</p>\\n<p>offset by losses in Europe.  We are now, however, generating real momentum abroad.  Contracts \\n(including 25-hour cards that we ourselves market in Europe) increased from 364 to 693 during the \\nyear.  We will again have a very significant European loss in 2005, but domestic earnings will likely \\nput us in the black overall. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Europe has been expensive for NetJets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 far more expensive than I anticipated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but it is essential to \\n</p>\\n<p>building a flight operation that will forever be in a class by itself.  Our U.S. owners already want a \\nquality service wherever they travel and their wish for flight hours abroad is certain to grow \\ndramatically in the decades ahead.  Last year, U.S. owners made 2,003 flights in Europe, up 22% from \\nthe previous year and 137% from 2000.  Just as important, our European owners made 1,067 flights in \\nthe U.S., up 65% from 2003 and 239% from 2000. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n<p> 15</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

(Previously, I had been \\nentranced by the stock market, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue about how to invest.) \\n \\n Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at how the businesses of our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Four\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 American Express, Coca-Cola, Gillette and \\nWells Fargo \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have fared since we bought into these companies.  As the table shows, we invested $3.83 \\nbillion in the four, by way of multiple transactions between May 1988 and October 2003.  On a composite \\nbasis, our dollar-weighted purchase date is July 1992.  By yearend 2004, therefore, we had held these \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness interests,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on a weighted basis, about 12\\xc2\\xbd years. \\n \\n In 2004, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings amounted to $1.2 billion.  These earnings might \\nlegitimately be considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  True, they were swelled because Gillette and Wells Fargo omitted \\noption costs in their presentation of earnings; but on the other hand they were reduced because Coke had a \\nnon-recurring write-off. \\n \\n Our share of the earnings of these four companies has grown almost every year, and now amounts \\nto about 31.3% of our cost.  Their cash distributions to us have also grown consistently, totaling $434 \\nmillion in 2004, or about 11.3% of cost.  All in all, the Big Four have delivered us a satisfactory, though far \\nfrom spectacular, business result. \\n \\n That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true as well of our experience in the market with the group.  Since our original purchases, \\nvaluation gains have somewhat exceeded earnings growth because price/earnings ratios have increased.  On \\na year-to-year basis, however, the business and market performances have often diverged, sometimes to an \\nextraordinary degree.  During The Great Bubble, market-value gains far outstripped the performance of the \\nbusinesses.  In the aftermath of the Bubble, the reverse was true. \\n</p>\\n<p> 16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Clearly, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results would have been far better if I had caught this swing of the pendulum.  \\nThat may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror.  Unfortunately, \\nhowever, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.  Our \\nhuge positions add to the difficulty of our nimbly dancing in and out of holdings as valuations swing. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, I can properly be criticized for merely clucking about nose-bleed valuations during \\nthe Bubble rather than acting on my views.  Though I said at the time that certain of the stocks we held \\nwere priced ahead of themselves, I underestimated just how severe the overvaluation was.  I talked when I \\nshould have walked. \\n \\n What Charlie and I would like is a little action now.

We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our \\nthinking about when, and if, to cash them depends not at all on a desire to report earnings at one specific \\ntime or another.  A further complication in our reported gains occurs because GAAP requires that foreign \\nexchange contracts be marked to market, a stipulation that causes unrealized gains or losses in these \\nholdings to flow through our published earnings as if we had sold our positions.   \\n \\n Despite the problems enumerated, you may be interested in a breakdown of the gains we reported \\nin 2003 and 2004.  The data reflect actual sales except in the case of currency gains, which are a \\ncombination of sales and marks to market. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Category Pre-Tax Gain (in $ millions) \\n 2004 2003 \\nCommon Stocks ............................. $   870 $   448 \\nU.S. Government Bonds................. 104 1,485 \\nJunk Bonds ..................................... 730 1,138 \\nForeign Exchange Contracts........... 1,839 825 \\nOther...............................................

When we bought these bonds in \\n2001 and 2002, we focused first, of course, on the credit quality of the issuers, all of which were American \\ncorporations.  Some of these companies, however, had issued bonds denominated in foreign currencies.  \\nBecause of our views on the dollar, we favored these for purchase when they were available. \\n \\n As an example, we bought \\xe2\\x82\\xac254 million of Level 3 bonds (10 \\xc2\\xbe% of 2008) in 2001 at 51.7% of \\npar, and sold these at 85% of par in December 2004.  This issue was traded in Euros that cost us 88\\xc2\\xa2 at the \\ntime of purchase but that brought $1.29 when we sold.  Thus, of our $163 million overall gain, about $85 \\nmillion came from the market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revised opinion about Level 3\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit quality, with the remaining $78 \\nmillion resulting from the appreciation of the Euro.

Lou Simpson manages about $2\\xc2\\xbd \\nbillion of equities that are held by GEICO, and it is his transactions that Berkshire is usually reporting.  \\nCustomarily his purchases are in the $200-$300 million range and are in companies that are smaller than \\nthe ones I focus on.  Take a look at the facing page to see why Lou is a cinch to be inducted into the \\ninvestment Hall of Fame. \\n \\n You may be surprised to learn that Lou does not necessarily inform me about what he is doing.  \\nWhen Charlie and I assign responsibility, we truly hand over the baton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we give it to Lou just as we \\ndo to our operating managers.  Therefore, I typically learn of Lou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transactions about ten days after the \\nend of each month.  Sometimes, it should be added, I silently disagree with his decisions.  But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s usually right. \\n \\nForeign Currencies \\n \\n Berkshire owned about $21.4 billion of foreign exchange contracts at yearend, spread among 12 \\ncurrencies.  As I mentioned last year, holdings of this kind are a decided change for us.  Before March \\n2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in currencies.  But the evidence grows that our trade policies \\nwill put unremitting pressure on the dollar for many years to come \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so since 2002 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heeded that \\nwarning in setting our investment course.  (As W.C. Fields once said when asked for a handout: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSorry, \\nson, all my money\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tied up in currency.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) \\n \\n Be clear on one point: In no way does our thinking about currencies rest on doubts about America.  \\nWe live in an extraordinarily rich country, the product of a system that values market economics, the rule \\nof law and equality of opportunity.  Our economy is far and away the strongest in the world and will \\ncontinue to be.  We are lucky to live here. \\n \\n But as I argued in a November 10, 2003 article in Fortune, (available at berkshirehathaway.com), \\nour country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trade practices are weighing down the dollar.  The decline in its value has already been \\nsubstantial, but is nevertheless likely to continue.  Without policy changes, currency markets could even \\nbecome disorderly and generate spillover effects, both political and financial.  No one knows whether these \\nproblems will materialize.  But such a scenario is a far-from-remote possibility that policymakers should be \\nconsidering now.  Their bent, however, is to lean toward not-so-benign neglect: A 318-page Congressional \\nstudy of the consequences of unremitting trade deficits was published in November 2000 and has been \\ngathering dust ever since.  The study was ordered after the deficit hit a then-alarming $263 billion in 1999; \\nby last year it had risen to $618 billion. \\n \\n Charlie and I, it should be emphasized, believe that true trade \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is, the exchange of goods and \\nservices with other countries \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is enormously beneficial for both us and them.  Last year we had $1.15 \\ntrillion of such honest-to-God trade and the more of this, the better.  But, as noted, our country also \\npurchased an additional $618 billion in goods and services from the rest of the world that was \\nunreciprocated.  That is a staggering figure and one that has important consequences.  \\n \\n The balancing item to this one-way pseudo-trade \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in economics there is always an offset \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is a \\ntransfer of wealth from the U.S. to the rest of the world.  The transfer may materialize in the form of IOUs \\nour private or governmental institutions give to foreigners, or by way of their assuming ownership of our \\nassets, such as stocks and real estate.  In either case, Americans end up owning a reduced portion of our \\ncountry while non-Americans own a greater part.  This force-feeding of American wealth to the rest of the \\nworld is now proceeding at the rate of $1.8 billion daily, an increase of 20% since I wrote you last year.  \\nConsequently, other countries and their citizens now own a net of about $3 trillion of the U.S.  A decade \\nago their net ownership was negligible. \\n \\n The mention of trillions numbs most brains.  A further source of confusion is that the current \\naccount deficit (the sum of three items, the most important by far being the trade deficit) and our national \\nbudget deficit are often lumped as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  They are anything but.  They have different causes and \\ndifferent consequences. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<div class=\"annotation\"><a href=\"www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf\">www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf</a></div>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> A budget deficit in no way reduces the portion of the national pie that goes to Americans.  As long \\nas other countries and their citizens have no net ownership of the U.S., 100% of our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s output \\nbelongs to our citizens under any budget scenario, even one involving a huge deficit. \\n \\n As a rich \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily\\xe2\\x80\\x9d awash in goods, Americans will argue through their legislators as to how \\ngovernment should redistribute the national output \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is who pays taxes and who receives governmental \\nbenefits.  If \\xe2\\x80\\x9centitlement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d promises from an earlier day have to be reexamined, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily members\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will \\nangrily debate among themselves as to who feels the pain.  Maybe taxes will go up; maybe promises will \\nbe modified; maybe more internal debt will be issued.  But when the fight is finished, all of the family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nhuge pie remains available for its members, however it is divided.  No slice must be sent abroad. \\n \\n Large and persisting current account deficits produce an entirely different result.  As time passes, \\nand as claims against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce.  In effect, the rest of the world \\nenjoys an ever-growing royalty on American output.  Here, we are like a family that consistently \\noverspends its income.  As time passes, the family finds that it is working more and more for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinance \\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and less for itself. \\n \\n Should we continue to run current account deficits comparable to those now prevailing, the net \\nownership of the U.S. by other countries and their citizens a decade from now will amount to roughly $11 \\ntrillion.  And, if foreign investors were to earn only 5% on that net holding, we would need to send a net of \\n$.55 trillion of goods and services abroad every year merely to service the U.S. investments then held by \\nforeigners.  At that date, a decade out, our GDP would probably total about $18 trillion (assuming low \\ninflation, which is far from a sure thing).  Therefore, our U.S. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would then be delivering 3% of its \\nannual output to the rest of the world simply as tribute for the overindulgences of the past.  In this case, \\nunlike that involving budget deficits, the sons would truly pay for the sins of their fathers. \\n \\n This annual royalty paid the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which would not disappear unless the U.S. massively \\nunderconsumed and began to run consistent and large trade surpluses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would undoubtedly produce \\nsignificant political unrest in the U.S.  Americans would still be living very well, indeed better than now \\nbecause of the growth in our economy.  But they would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to \\ntheir creditors and owners abroad.  A country that is now aspiring to an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOwnership Society\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will not find \\nhappiness in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use hyperbole here for emphasis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSharecropper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Society.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precisely \\nwhere our trade policies, supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, are taking us. \\n \\n Many prominent U.S. financial figures, both in and out of government, have stated that our \\ncurrent-account deficits cannot persist.  For instance, the minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market \\nCommittee of June 29-30, 2004 say: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe staff noted that outsized external deficits could not be sustained \\nindefinitely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  But, despite the constant handwringing by luminaries, they offer no substantive suggestions \\nto tame the burgeoning imbalance. \\n \\n In the article I wrote for Fortune 16 months ago, I warned that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca gently declining dollar would \\nnot provide the answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  And so far it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.  Yet policymakers continue to hope for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoft landing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\nmeanwhile counseling other countries to stimulate (read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinflate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) their economies and Americans to save \\nmore.  In my view these admonitions miss the mark:  There are deep-rooted structural problems that will \\ncause America to continue to run a huge current-account deficit unless trade policies either change \\nmaterially or the dollar declines by a degree that could prove unsettling to financial markets. \\n \\n Proponents of the trade status quo are fond of quoting Adam Smith: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is prudence in the \\nconduct of every family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.  If a foreign country can supply us \\nwith a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the \\nproduce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n I agree.  Note, however, that Mr. Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement refers to trade of product for product, not of \\nwealth for product as our country is doing to the tune of $.6 trillion annually.  Moreover, I am sure that he \\nwould never have suggested that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprudence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d consisted of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily\\xe2\\x80\\x9d selling off part of its farm every day \\n</p>\\n<p> 20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Yet that is just what the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat kingdom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d called the United States \\nis doing. \\n \\n If the U.S. was running a $.6 trillion current-account surplus, commentators worldwide would \\nviolently condemn our policy, viewing it as an extreme form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmercantilism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a long-discredited \\neconomic strategy under which countries fostered exports, discouraged imports, and piled up treasure.  I \\nwould condemn such a policy as well.  But, in effect if not in intent, the rest of the world is practicing \\nmercantilism in respect to the U.S., an act made possible by our vast store of assets and our pristine credit \\nhistory.  Indeed, the world would never let any other country use a credit card denominated in its own \\ncurrency to the insatiable extent we are employing ours.  Presently, most foreign investors are sanguine: \\nthey may view us as spending junkies, but they know we are rich junkies as well. \\n \\n Our spendthrift behavior won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, however, be tolerated indefinitely.  And though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible to \\nforecast just when and how the trade problem will be resolved, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s improbable that the resolution will \\nfoster an increase in the value of our currency relative to that of our trading partners.   \\n \\n We hope the U.S. adopts policies that will quickly and substantially reduce the current-account \\ndeficit.  True, a prompt solution would likely cause Berkshire to record losses on its foreign-exchange \\ncontracts.  But Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resources remain heavily concentrated in dollar-based assets, and both a strong \\ndollar and a low-inflation environment are very much in our interest.   \\n \\n If you wish to keep abreast of trade and currency matters, read The Financial Times.

Both its reporting and commentary on trade are first-class. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n And, again, our usual caveat: macro-economics is a tough game in which few people, Charlie and \\nI included, have demonstrated skill.  We may well turn out to be wrong in our currency judgments.  \\n(Indeed, the fact that so many pundits now predict weakness for the dollar makes us uneasy.)  If so, our \\nmistake will be very public.  The irony is that if we chose the opposite course, leaving all of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nassets in dollars even as they declined significantly in value, no one would notice our mistake.  \\n \\n John Maynard Keynes said in his masterful The General Theory:  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorldly wisdom teaches that it \\nis better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Or, to put it in less elegant \\nterms, lemmings as a class may be derided but never does an individual lemming get criticized.)  From a \\nreputational standpoint, Charlie and I run a clear risk with our foreign-exchange commitment.  But we \\nbelieve in managing Berkshire as if we owned 100% of it ourselves.  And, were that the case, we would not \\nbe following a dollar-only policy. \\n \\nMiscellaneous \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Last year I told you about a group of University of Tennessee finance students who played a key \\nrole in our $1.7 billion acquisition of Clayton Homes.

Most \\nof the students are MBA candidates, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been impressed by their quality.  They are keenly \\ninterested in business and investments, but their questions indicate that they also have more on \\ntheir minds than simply making money.

       "  '21': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>At our sessions, I tell the newcomers the story of the Tennessee group and its spotting of Clayton \\nHomes.  I do this in the spirit of the farmer who enters his hen house with an ostrich egg and \\nadmonishes the flock: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to complain, girls, but this is just a small sample of what the \\ncompetition is doing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  To date, our new scouts have not brought us deals.  But their mission in \\nlife has been made clear to them. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 You should be aware of an accounting rule that mildly distorts our financial statements in a pain-\\n</p>\\n<p>today, gain-tomorrow manner.  Berkshire purchases life insurance policies from individuals and \\ncorporations who would otherwise surrender them for cash.  As the new holder of the policies, we \\npay any premiums that become due and ultimately \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when the original holder dies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 collect the \\nface value of the policies. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nThe original policyholder is usually in good health when we purchase the policy.  Still, the price \\nwe pay for it is always well above its cash surrender value (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCSV\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  Sometimes the original \\npolicyholder has borrowed against the CSV to make premium payments.  In that case, the \\nremaining CSV will be tiny and our purchase price will be a large multiple of what the original \\npolicyholder would have received, had he cashed out by surrendering it. \\n \\nUnder accounting rules, we must immediately charge as a realized capital loss the excess over \\nCSV that we pay upon purchasing the policy.  We also must make additional charges each year for \\nthe amount by which the premium we pay to keep the policy in force exceeds the increase in CSV.  \\nBut obviously, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think these bookkeeping charges represent economic losses.  If we did, \\nwe wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy the policies. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nDuring 2004, we recorded net \\xe2\\x80\\x9closses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the purchase of policies (and from the premium \\npayments required to maintain them) totaling $207 million, which was charged against realized \\ninvestment gains in our earnings statement (included in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in the table on page 17).  When \\nthe proceeds from these policies are received in the future, we will record as realized investment \\ngain the excess over the then-CSV. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Two post-bubble governance reforms have been particularly useful at Berkshire, and I fault myself \\n</p>\\n<p>for not putting them in place many years ago.  The first involves regular meetings of directors \\nwithout the CEO present.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sat on 19 boards, and on many occasions this process would have \\nled to dubious plans being examined more thoroughly.  In a few cases, CEO changes that were \\nneeded would also have been made more promptly.  There is no downside to this process, and \\nthere are many possible benefits. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nThe second reform concerns the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhistleblower line,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an arrangement through which employees \\ncan send information to me and the board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s audit committee without fear of reprisal.  Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nextreme decentralization makes this system particularly valuable both to me and the committee.  \\n(In a sprawling \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of 180,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current employee count \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not every sparrow that \\nfalls will be noticed at headquarters.)  Most of the complaints we have received are of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe guy \\nnext to me has bad breath\\xe2\\x80\\x9d variety, but on occasion I have learned of important problems at our \\nsubsidiaries that I otherwise would have missed.  The issues raised are usually not of a type \\ndiscoverable by audit, but relate instead to personnel and business practices.  Berkshire would be \\nmore valuable today if I had put in a whistleblower line decades ago. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Charlie and I love the idea of shareholders thinking and behaving like owners.  Sometimes that \\n</p>\\n<p>requires them to be pro-active.  And in this arena large institutional owners should lead the way. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>So far, however, the moves made by institutions have been less than awe-inspiring.  Usually, \\nthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve focused on minutiae and ignored the three questions that truly count.  First, does the \\ncompany have the right CEO?  Second, is he/she overreaching in terms of compensation?  Third, \\nare proposed acquisitions more likely to create or destroy per-share value? \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 22</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '22': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>On such questions, the interests of the CEO may well differ from those of the shareholders.  \\nDirectors, moreover, sometimes lack the knowledge or gumption to overrule the CEO.

In Matthew 6:21 He observed: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor where your treasure is, \\nthere will your heart be also.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Even to an institutional investor, $8 billion should qualify as \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreasure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that dwarfs any profits Berkshire might earn on its routine transactions with Coke. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nMeasured by the biblical standard, the Berkshire board is a model: (a) every director is a member \\nof a family owning at least $4 million of stock; (b) none of these shares were acquired from \\nBerkshire via options or grants; (c) no directors receive committee, consulting or board fees from \\nthe company that are more than a tiny portion of their annual income; and (d) although we have a \\nstandard corporate indemnity arrangement, we carry no liability insurance for directors. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nAt Berkshire, board members travel the same road as shareholders. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nCharlie and I have seen much behavior confirming the Bible\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreasure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d point.  In our view, \\nbased on our considerable boardroom experience, the least independent directors are likely to be \\nthose who receive an important fraction of their annual income from the fees they receive for \\nboard service (and who hope as well to be recommended for election to other boards and thereby \\nto boost their income further).  Yet these are the very board members most often classed as \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nMost directors of this type are decent people and do a first-class job.  But they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be human \\nif they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tempted to thwart actions that would threaten their livelihood.  Some may go on to \\nsuccumb to such temptations. \\n \\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at an example based upon circumstantial evidence.  I have first-hand knowledge of a \\nrecent acquisition proposal (not from Berkshire) that was favored by management, blessed by the \\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment banker and slated to go forward at a price above the level at which the \\nstock had sold for some years (or now sells for).  In addition, a number of directors favored the \\ntransaction and wanted it proposed to shareholders. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n<p> 23</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '23': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Several of their brethren, however, each of whom received board and committee fees totaling \\nabout $100,000 annually, scuttled the proposal, which meant that shareholders never learned of \\nthis multi-billion offer.  Non-management directors owned little stock except for shares they had \\nreceived from the company.  Their open-market purchases in recent years had meanwhile been \\nnominal, even though the stock had sold far below the acquisition price proposed.  In other words, \\nthese directors didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the shareholders to be offered X even though they had consistently \\ndeclined the opportunity to buy stock for their own account at a fraction of X. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know which directors opposed letting shareholders see the offer.  But I do know that \\n$100,000 is an important portion of the annual income of some of those deemed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\nclearly meeting the Matthew 6:21 definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  If the deal had gone through, these fees \\nwould have ended. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nNeither the shareholders nor I will ever know what motivated the dissenters.  Indeed they \\nthemselves will not likely know, given that self-interest inevitably blurs introspection.  We do \\nknow one thing, though: At the same meeting at which the deal was rejected, the board voted itself \\na significant increase in directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fees. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 While we are on the subject of self-interest, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn again to the most important accounting \\n</p>\\n<p>mechanism still available to CEOs who wish to overstate earnings: the non-expensing of stock \\noptions.  The accomplices in perpetuating this absurdity have been many members of Congress \\nwho have defied the arguments put forth by all Big Four auditors, all members of the Financial \\nAccounting Standards Board and virtually all investment professionals. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m enclosing an op-ed piece I wrote for The Washington Post describing a truly breathtaking bill \\nthat was passed 312-111 by the House last summer.  Thanks to Senator Richard Shelby, the Senate \\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ratify the House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foolishness.  And, to his great credit, Bill Donaldson, the investor-\\nminded Chairman of the SEC, has stood firm against massive political pressure, generated by the \\ncheck-waving CEOs who first muscled Congress in 1993 about the issue of option accounting and \\nthen repeated the tactic last year. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nBecause the attempts to obfuscate the stock-option issue continue, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth pointing out that no \\none \\xe2\\x80\\x93 neither the FASB, nor investors generally, nor I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are talking about restricting the use of \\noptions in any way.  Indeed, my successor at Berkshire may well receive much of his pay via \\noptions, albeit logically-structured ones in respect to 1) an appropriate strike price, 2) an escalation \\nin price that reflects the retention of earnings, and 3) a ban on his quickly disposing of any shares \\npurchased through options.  We cheer arrangements that motivate managers, whether these be \\ncash bonuses or options.  And if a company is truly receiving value for the options it issues, we \\nsee no reason why recording their cost should cut down on their use. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nThe simple fact is that certain CEOs know their own compensation would be far more rationally \\ndetermined if options were expensed.  They also suspect that their stock would sell at a lower price \\nif realistic accounting were employed, meaning that they would reap less in the market when they \\nunloaded their personal holdings.  To these CEOs such unpleasant prospects are a fate to be fought \\nwith all the resources they have at hand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though the funds they use in that fight normally \\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to them, but are instead put up by their shareholders. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Option-expensing is scheduled to become mandatory on June 15th.  You can therefore expect \\n</p>\\n<p>intensified efforts to stall or emasculate this rule between now and then.  Let your Congressman \\nand Senators know what you think on this issue. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n<p> 24</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<div class=\"annotation\"><a href=\"www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/options.pdf\">www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/options.pdf</a></div>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '24': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The Annual Meeting \\n \\n There are two changes this year concerning the annual meeting.  First, we have scheduled the \\nmeeting for the last Saturday in April (the 30th), rather than the usual first Saturday in May.  This year \\nMother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day falls on May 8, and it would be unfair to ask the employees of Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to \\ntake care of us at that special time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve moved everything up a week.  Next year we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll return to our \\nregular timing, holding the meeting on May 6, 2006. \\n \\n Additionally, we are changing the sequence of events on meeting day, April 30.  Just as always, \\nthe doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m. and the movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30, however, \\nwe will go directly to the question and answer period, which (allowing for lunch at the Qwest\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stands) will \\nlast until 3:00.  Then, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15. \\n \\n We have made this change because a number of shareholders complained last year about the time \\nconsumed by two speakers who advocated proposals of limited interest to the majority of the audience \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nand who were no doubt relishing their chance to talk to a captive group of about 19,500.  With our new \\nprocedure, those shareholders who wish to hear it all can stick around for the formal meeting and those who \\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t can leave \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or better yet shop. \\n \\n There will be plenty of opportunity for that pastime in the vast exhibition hall that adjoins the \\nmeeting area.  Kelly Muchemore, the Flo Ziegfeld of Berkshire, put on a magnificent shopping \\nextravaganza last year, and she says that was just a warm-up for this year.  (Kelly, I am delighted to report, \\nis getting married in October.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving her away and suggested that she make a little history by holding \\nthe wedding at the annual meeting.  She balked, however, when Charlie insisted that he be the ringbearer.) \\n \\n Again we will showcase a 2,100 square foot Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, \\nJohns Manville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  Take a tour through \\nthe home.  Better yet, buy it. \\n \\n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \\nwhich we operate.  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you \\nmoney. \\n \\n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets\\xc2\\xae \\navailable for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  \\nCome to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane. \\n \\n The Bookworm shop did a terrific business last year selling Berkshire-related books.  Displaying \\n18 titles, they sold 2,920 copies for $61,000.  Since we charge the shop no rent (I must be getting soft), it \\ngives shareholders a 20% discount.  This year I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked The Bookworm to add Graham Allison\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nuclear \\nTerrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, a must-read for those concerned with the safety of our \\ncountry.  In addition, the shop will premiere Poor Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Almanack, a book compiled by Peter Kaufman.  \\nScholars have for too long debated whether Charlie is the reincarnation of Ben Franklin.  This book should \\nsettle the question. \\n \\n An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  They do \\na terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it. \\n \\n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \\nwe will again be having \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM eight years \\nago, and sales during the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $25.1 million in 2004 (up 45% \\n</p>\\n<p> 25</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '25': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>from a year earlier).  Every year has set a new record, and on Saturday of last year, we had the largest \\nsingle-day sales in NFM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $6.1 million. \\n \\n To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 28 and Monday, \\nMay 2 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will even apply to \\nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but \\nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their \\ncooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on \\nSunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we are having a special affair for shareholders \\nonly.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be there, eating barbeque and drinking Coke. \\n \\n Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manhattan store \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will \\nhave two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, \\nApril 29.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 1.  On Saturday, we \\nwill be open until 6 p.m.   \\n \\n We will have huge crowds at Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, \\ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25 through Saturday, May 7.  During \\nthat period, just identify yourself as a shareholder through your meeting credentials or a brokerage \\nstatement.   \\n \\n Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its \\nmajor rivals, even before the shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 discount.  Last year, business over the weekend increased 73% \\nfrom 2003, setting a record that will be tough to beat.  Show me it can be done. \\n \\n In a tent outside of Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers \\nin groups of six \\xe2\\x80\\x93 blindfolded.  Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the \\nworld\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They plan to keep \\ntheir eyes open \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but Bob never sorts his cards, even when playing for a national championship. \\n \\n Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my favorite steakhouse \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on \\nSunday, May 1, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on \\nthat day, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).  If \\nSunday is sold out, try Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on one of the other evenings you will be in town.  Enhance your reputation \\nas an epicure by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double helping of hash browns. \\n \\n We will again have a special reception from 4:00 to 5:30 on Saturday afternoon for shareholders \\nwho have come from outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around \\nthe globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we \\nenjoyed meeting more than 400 of you including at least 100 from Australia.  Any shareholder who comes \\nfrom other than the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this \\nfunction. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n \\n Charlie and I are lucky.  We have jobs that we love and are helped every day in a myriad of ways \\nby talented and cheerful associates.  No wonder we tap-dance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us than \\ngetting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual meeting.  So join us on April 30th at the \\nQwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. \\n \\n \\nFebruary 28, 2005    Warren E.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> \\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n \\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\n \\n Our gain in net worth during 2005 was $5.6 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%.  Over the last 41 years (that is, since present management \\ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $59,377, a rate of 21.5% compounded annually.* \\n \\n Berkshire had a decent year in 2005.  We initiated five acquisitions (two of which have yet to \\nclose) and most of our operating subsidiaries prospered.  Even our insurance business in its entirety did \\nwell, though Hurricane Katrina inflicted record losses on both Berkshire and the industry.  We estimate our \\nloss from Katrina at $2.5 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and her ugly sisters, Rita and Wilma, cost us an additional $.9 billion.  \\n \\n Credit GEICO \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and its brilliant CEO, Tony Nicely \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for our stellar insurance results in a disaster-\\nridden year.  One statistic stands out: In just two years, GEICO improved its productivity by 32%.  \\nRemarkably, employment fell by 4% even as policy count grew by 26% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and more gains are in store.  \\nWhen we drive unit costs down in such a dramatic manner, we can offer ever-greater value to our \\ncustomers.  The payoff: Last year, GEICO gained market-share, earned commendable profits and \\nstrengthened its brand.  If you have a new son or grandson in 2006, name him Tony. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n My goal in writing this report is to give you the information you need to estimate Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nintrinsic value.  I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cestimate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because calculations of intrinsic value, though all-important, are \\nnecessarily imprecise and often seriously wrong.  The more uncertain the future of a business, the more \\npossibility there is that the calculation will be wildly off-base.  (For an explanation of intrinsic value, see \\npages 77 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 78.)  Here Berkshire has some advantages: a wide variety of relatively-stable earnings streams, \\ncombined with great liquidity and minimum debt.  These factors mean that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value can \\nbe more precisely calculated than can the intrinsic value of most companies. \\n \\n Yet if precision is aided by Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial characteristics, the job of calculating intrinsic \\nvalue has been made more complex by the mere presence of so many earnings streams.  Back in 1965, \\nwhen we owned only a small textile operation, the task of calculating intrinsic value was a snap.  Now we \\nown 68 distinct businesses with widely disparate operating and financial characteristics.  This array of \\nunrelated enterprises, coupled with our massive investment holdings, makes it impossible for you to simply \\nexamine our consolidated financial statements and arrive at an informed estimate of intrinsic value. \\n \\n We have attempted to ease this problem by clustering our businesses into four logical groups, each \\nof which we discuss later in this report.  In these discussions, we will provide the key figures for both the \\ngroup and its important components.  Of course, the value of Berkshire may be either greater or less than \\nthe sum of these four parts.  The outcome depends on whether our many units function better or worse by \\nbeing part of a larger enterprise and whether capital allocation improves or deteriorates when it is under the \\ndirection of a holding company.  In other words, does Berkshire ownership bring anything to the party, or \\nwould our shareholders be better off if they directly owned shares in each of our 68 businesses?  These are \\nimportant questions but ones that you will have to answer for yourself. \\n \\n Before we look at our individual businesses, however, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review two sets of figures that show \\nwhere we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come from and where we are now.  The first set is the amount of investments (including cash \\nand cash-equivalents) we own on a per-share basis.  In making this calculation, we exclude investments \\nheld in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings: \\n  \\n *All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares, the successor to the only stock that \\nthe company had outstanding before 1996.

If either year was aberrational, any calculation of growth will be \\ndistorted.  In particular, a base year in which earnings were poor can produce a breathtaking, but \\nmeaningless, growth rate.  In the table above, however, the base year of 1965 was abnormally good; \\nBerkshire earned more money in that year than it did in all but one of the previous ten. \\n \\n As you can see from the two tables, the comparative growth rates of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two elements of \\nvalue have changed in the last decade, a result reflecting our ever-increasing emphasis on business \\nacquisitions.  Nevertheless, Charlie Munger, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I want to \\nincrease the figures in both tables.

But they will not in themselves produce truly satisfactory gains.  We will need major acquisitions \\nto get that job done. \\n \\n In this quest, 2005 was encouraging.  We agreed to five purchases: two that were completed last \\nyear, one that closed after yearend and two others that we expect to close soon.  None of the deals involve \\nthe issuance of Berkshire shares.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a crucial, but often ignored, point: When a management proudly \\nacquires another company for stock, the shareholders of the acquirer are concurrently selling part of their \\ninterest in everything they own.

Malpractice insurance is tough to underwrite and has \\nproved to be a graveyard for many insurers.  MedPro nevertheless should do well.  It will have the \\nattitudinal advantage that all Berkshire insurers share, wherein underwriting discipline trumps all \\nother goals.  Additionally, as part of Berkshire, MedPro has financial strength far exceeding that of \\nits competitors, a quality assuring doctors that long-to-settle claims will not end up back on their \\ndoorstep because their insurer failed.  Finally, the company has a smart and energetic CEO, Tim \\nKenesey, who instinctively thinks like a Berkshire manager. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Forest River, our second acquisition, closed on August 31.  A couple of months earlier, on June \\n</p>\\n<p>21, I received a two-page fax telling me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 point by point \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why Forest River met the acquisition \\ncriteria we set forth on page 25 of this report.  I had not before heard of the company, a \\nrecreational vehicle manufacturer with $1.6 billion of sales, nor of Pete Liegl, its owner and \\nmanager.  But the fax made sense, and I immediately asked for more figures.  These came the next \\nmorning, and that afternoon I made Pete an offer.  On June 28, we shook hands on a deal. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nPete is a remarkable entrepreneur.  Some years back, he sold his business, then far smaller than \\ntoday, to an LBO operator who promptly began telling him how to run the place.  Before long, \\nPete left, and the business soon sunk into bankruptcy.  Pete then repurchased it.  You can be sure \\nthat I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be telling Pete how to manage his operation. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nForest River has 60 plants, 5,400 employees and has consistently gained share in the RV business, \\nwhile also expanding into other areas such as boats.  Pete is 61 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and definitely in an acceleration \\nmode.  Read the piece from RV Business that accompanies this report, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see why Pete and \\nBerkshire are made for each other. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 On November 12, 2005, an article ran in The Wall Street Journal dealing with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unusual \\nacquisition and managerial practices.  In it Pete declared, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was easier to sell my business than to \\nrenew my driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nIn New York, Cathy Baron Tamraz read the article, and it struck a chord.  On November 21, she \\nsent me a letter that began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs president of Business Wire, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to introduce you to my \\ncompany, as I believe it fits the profile of Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary companies as detailed in \\na recent Wall Street Journal article.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\nBy the time I finished Cathy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two-page letter, I felt Business Wire and Berkshire were a fit.  I \\nparticularly liked her penultimate paragraph: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe run a tight ship and keep unnecessary spending \\nunder wraps.  No secretaries or management layers here.  Yet we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll invest big dollars to gain a \\ntechnological advantage and move the business forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\nI promptly gave Cathy a call, and before long Berkshire had reached agreement with Business \\nWire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controlling shareholder, Lorry Lokey, who founded the company in 1961 (and who had \\njust made Cathy CEO).  I love success stories like Lorry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  Today 78, he has built a company that \\ndisseminates information in 150 countries for 25,000 clients.  His story, like those of many \\nentrepreneurs who have selected Berkshire as a home for their life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work, is an example of what \\ncan happen when a good idea, a talented individual and hard work converge. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In December we agreed to buy 81% of Applied Underwriters, a company that offers a combination \\nof payroll services and workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation insurance to small businesses.

Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies, who \\nhave built Applied\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarkable business, concluded that Omaha had many advantages as an \\noperational base \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a brilliant insight, I might add \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and today 400 of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 479 \\nemployees are located here. \\n \\nLess than a year ago, Applied entered into a large reinsurance contract with Ajit Jain, the \\nextraordinary manager of National Indemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division.  Ajit was impressed by Sid \\nand Steve, and they liked Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s method of operation.  So we decided to join forces.  We are \\npleased that Sid and Steve retain 19% of Applied.  They started on a shoestring only 12 years ago, \\nand it will be fun to see what they can accomplish with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s backing. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Last spring, MidAmerican Energy, our 80.5% owned subsidiary, agreed to buy PacifiCorp, a \\nmajor electric utility serving six Western states.  An acquisition of this sort requires many \\nregulatory approvals, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve now obtained these and expect to close this transaction soon. \\nBerkshire will then buy $3.4 billion of MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common stock, which MidAmerican will \\nsupplement with $1.7 billion of borrowing to complete the purchase.  You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect to earn \\noutsized profits in regulated utilities, but the industry offers owners the opportunity to deploy large \\nsums at fair returns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and therefore, it makes good sense for Berkshire.  A few years back, I said \\nthat we hoped to make some very large purchases in the utility field.  Note the plural \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be \\nlooking for more. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n In addition to buying these new operations, we continue to make \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbolt-on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquisitions.  Some \\naren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so small: Shaw, our carpet operation, spent about $550 million last year on two purchases that \\nfurthered its vertical integration and should improve its profit margin in the future.  XTRA and Clayton \\nHomes also made value-enhancing acquisitions. \\n \\n Unlike many business buyers, Berkshire has no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexit strategy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  We buy to keep.  We do, though, \\nhave an entrance strategy, looking for businesses in this country or abroad that meet our six criteria and are \\navailable at a price that will produce a reasonable return.  If you have a business that fits, give me a call.  \\nLike a hopeful teenage girl, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be waiting by the phone. \\n \\nInsurance \\n \\n Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now talk about our four sectors and start with insurance, our core business.  What counts \\nhere is the amount of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and its cost over time. \\n \\n For new readers, let me explain.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is money that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to us but that we \\ntemporarily hold.  Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we \\nprovide \\xe2\\x80\\x93 insurance protection \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events \\nthat occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many \\nyears for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled.  The $20 \\nmillion of float that came with our 1967 entry into insurance has now increased \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both by way of internal \\ngrowth and acquisitions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to $49 billion. \\n \\n Float is wonderful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come at a high price.  Its cost is determined by underwriting \\nresults, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have \\nreceived.  When an insurer earns an underwriting profit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of \\nthe 39 years we have been in the insurance business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 float is better than free.  In such years, we are \\nactually paid for holding other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money.  For most insurers, however, life has been far more \\ndifficult: In aggregate, the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss.  \\nWhen that loss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so. \\n \\n \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> In 2004 our float cost us less than nothing, and I told you that we had a chance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 absent a mega-\\ncatastrophe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of no-cost float in 2005.  But we had the mega-cat, and as a specialist in that coverage, \\nBerkshire suffered hurricane losses of $3.4 billion.  Nevertheless, our float was costless in 2005 because of \\nthe superb results we had in our other insurance activities, particularly at GEICO. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Auto policies in force grew by 12.1% at GEICO, a gain increasing its market share of U.S. private \\npassenger auto business from about 5.6% to about 6.1%.  Auto insurance is a big business: Each share-\\npoint equates to $1.6 billion in sales. \\n \\n While our brand strength is not quantifiable, I believe it also grew significantly.  When Berkshire \\nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its annual advertising expenditures were $31 million.  Last year we \\nwere up to $502 million.  And I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to spend more. \\n \\n Our advertising works because we have a great story to tell: More people can save money by \\ninsuring with us than is the case with any other national carrier offering policies to all comers.  (Some \\nspecialized auto insurers do particularly well for applicants fitting into their niches; also, because our \\nnational competitors use rating systems that differ from ours, they will sometimes beat our price.)  Last \\nyear, we achieved by far the highest conversion rate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the percentage of internet and phone quotes turned \\ninto sales \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in our history.  This is powerful evidence that our prices are more attractive relative to the \\ncompetition than ever before.  Test us by going to GEICO.com or by calling 800-847-7536.  Be sure to \\nindicate you are a shareholder because that fact will often qualify you for a discount. \\n \\n I told you last year about GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entry into New Jersey in August, 2004.  Drivers in that state \\nlove us.  Our retention rate there for new policyholders is running higher than in any other state, and by \\nsometime in 2007, GEICO is likely to become the third largest auto insurer in New Jersey.  There, as \\nelsewhere, our low costs allow low prices that lead to steady gains in profitable business. \\n \\n That simple formula immediately impressed me 55 years ago when I first discovered GEICO.  \\nIndeed, at age 21, I wrote an article about the company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reproduced on page 24 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when its market \\nvalue was $7 million.  As you can see, I called GEICO \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Security I Like Best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I still \\ncall it.  \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n We have major reinsurance operations at General Re and National Indemnity.  The former is run \\nby Joe Brandon and Tad Montross, the latter by Ajit Jain.  Both units performed well in 2005 considering \\nthe extraordinary hurricane losses that battered the industry. \\n \\n It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an open question whether atmospheric, oceanic or other causal factors have dramatically \\nchanged the frequency or intensity of hurricanes.  Recent experience is worrisome.  We know, for instance, \\nthat in the 100 years before 2004, about 59 hurricanes of Category 3 strength, or greater, hit the \\nSoutheastern and Gulf Coast states, and that only three of these were Category 5s.  We further know that in \\n2004 there were three Category 3 storms that hammered those areas and that these were followed by four \\nmore in 2005, one of them, Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in industry history.  Moreover, there \\nwere three Category 5s near the coast last year that fortunately weakened before landfall. \\n \\n Was this onslaught of more frequent and more intense storms merely an anomaly?  Or was it \\ncaused by changes in climate, water temperature or other variables we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fully understand?  And could \\nthese factors be developing in a manner that will soon produce disasters dwarfing Katrina?  \\n \\n Joe, Ajit and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the answer to these all-important questions.  What we do know is that \\nour ignorance means we must follow the course prescribed by Pascal in his famous wager about the \\nexistence of God.  As you may recall, he concluded that since he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the answer, his personal \\ngain/loss ratio dictated an affirmative conclusion. \\n \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> So guided, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve concluded that we should now write mega-cat policies only at prices far higher \\nthan prevailed last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then only with an aggregate exposure that would not cause us distress if shifts \\nin some important variable produce far more costly storms in the near future.  To a lesser degree, we felt \\nthis way after 2004 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and cut back our writings when prices didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move.  Now our caution has intensified.  \\nIf prices seem appropriate, however, we continue to have both the ability and the appetite to be the largest \\nwriter of mega-cat coverage in the world. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Our smaller insurers, with MedPro added to the fold, delivered truly outstanding results last year.  \\nHowever, what you see in the table below does not do full justice to their performance.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because we \\nincreased the loss reserves of MedPro by about $125 million immediately after our purchase. \\n \\n No one knows with any precision what amount will be required to pay the claims we inherited.  \\nMedical malpractice insurance is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clong-tail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d line, meaning that claims often take many years to settle.  In \\naddition, there are other losses that have occurred, but that we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even hear about for some time.  One \\nthing, though, we have learned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the hard way \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after many years in the business: Surprises in insurance are \\nfar from symmetrical.  You are lucky if you get one that is pleasant for every ten that go the other way.  \\nToo often, however, insurers react to looming loss problems with optimism.  They behave like the fellow in \\na switchblade fight who, after his opponent has taken a mighty swipe at his throat, exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou never \\ntouched me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  His adversary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust wait until you try to shake your head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n Excluding the reserves we added for prior periods, MedPro wrote at an underwriting profit.  And \\nour other primary companies, in aggregate, had an underwriting profit of $324 million on $1,270 million of \\nvolume.  This is an extraordinary result, and our thanks go to Rod Eldred of Berkshire Hathaway \\nHomestate Companies, John Kizer of Central States Indemnity, Tom Nerney of U. S.

Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating expertise and \\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial resources have made this an excellent business for us and one in which we are \\npreeminent.  We presently service $17 billion of loans, compared to $5.4 billon at the time of our purchase.  \\nMoreover, Clayton now owns $9.6 billion of its servicing portfolio, a position built up almost entirely since \\nBerkshire entered the picture. \\n \\n To finance this portfolio, Clayton borrows money from Berkshire, which in turn borrows the same \\namount publicly.  For the use of its credit, Berkshire charges Clayton a one percentage-point markup on its \\nborrowing cost.  In 2005, the cost to Clayton for this arrangement was $83 million.  That amount is \\nincluded in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOther\\xe2\\x80\\x9d income in the table on the facing page, and Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings of $416 million are after \\ndeducting this payment. \\n \\n On the manufacturing side, Clayton has also been active.  To its original base of twenty plants, it \\nfirst added twelve more in 2004 by way of the bankruptcy purchase of Oakwood, which just a few years \\nearlier was one of the largest companies in the business.  Then in 2005 Clayton purchased Karsten, a four-\\nplant operation that greatly strengthens Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position on the West Coast. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Long ago, Mark Twain said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man who tries to carry a cat home by its tail will learn a lesson \\nthat can be learned in no other way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a derivatives \\nbusiness.  After a few days, he would opt for cats. \\n \\n We lost $104 million pre-tax last year in our continuing attempt to exit Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s derivative \\noperation.  Our aggregate losses since we began this endeavor total $404 million. \\n \\n Originally we had 23,218 contracts outstanding.  By the start of 2005 we were down to 2,890.  \\nYou might expect that our losses would have been stemmed by this point, but the blood has kept flowing.  \\nReducing our inventory to 741 contracts last year cost us the $104 million mentioned above. \\n \\n Remember that the rationale for establishing this unit in 1990 was Gen Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wish to meet the \\nneeds of insurance clients.  Yet one of the contracts we liquidated in 2005 had a term of 100 years!  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\ndifficult to imagine what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such a contract could fulfill except, perhaps, the need of a compensation-\\nconscious trader to have a long-dated contract on his books.  Long contracts, or alternatively those with \\nmultiple variables, are the most difficult to mark to market (the standard procedure used in accounting for \\nderivatives) and provide the most opportunity for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimagination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when traders are estimating their value.  \\nSmall wonder that traders promote them. \\n \\n A business in which huge amounts of compensation flow from assumed numbers is obviously \\nfraught with danger.  When two traders execute a transaction that has several, sometimes esoteric, variables \\nand a far-off settlement date, their respective firms must subsequently value these contracts whenever they \\ncalculate their earnings.  A given contract may be valued at one price by Firm A and at another by Firm B.  \\nYou can bet that the valuation differences \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m personally familiar with several that were huge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tend \\nto be tilted in a direction favoring higher earnings at each firm.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a strange world in which two parties \\ncan carry out a paper transaction that each can promptly report as profitable. \\n \\n I dwell on our experience in derivatives each year for two reasons.  One is personal and \\nunpleasant.  The hard fact is that I have cost you a lot of money by not moving immediately to close down \\n</p>\\n<p> 10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Both Charlie and I knew at the time of the Gen Re purchase that it was a \\nproblem and told its management that we wanted to exit the business.  It was my responsibility to make \\nsure that happened.  Rather than address the situation head on, however, I wasted several years while we \\nattempted to sell the operation.  That was a doomed endeavor because no realistic solution could have \\nextricated us from the maze of liabilities that was going to exist for decades.  Our obligations were \\nparticularly worrisome because their potential to explode could not be measured.  Moreover, if severe \\ntrouble occurred, we knew it was likely to correlate with problems elsewhere in financial markets. \\n \\n So I failed in my attempt to exit painlessly, and in the meantime more trades were put on the \\nbooks.  Fault me for dithering.  (Charlie calls it thumb-sucking.)  When a problem exists, whether in \\npersonnel or in business operations, the time to act is now. \\n \\n The second reason I regularly describe our problems in this area lies in the hope that our \\nexperiences may prove instructive for managers, auditors and regulators.  In a sense, we are a canary in this \\nbusiness coal mine and should sing a song of warning as we expire.  The number and value of derivative \\ncontracts outstanding in the world continues to mushroom and is now a multiple of what existed in 1998, \\nthe last time that financial chaos erupted. \\n \\n Our experience should be particularly sobering because we were a better-than-average candidate \\nto exit gracefully.  Gen Re was a relatively minor operator in the derivatives field.  It has had the good \\nfortune to unwind its supposedly liquid positions in a benign market, all the while free of financial or other \\npressures that might have forced it to conduct the liquidation in a less-than-efficient manner.  Our \\naccounting in the past was conventional and actually thought to be conservative.  Additionally, we know of \\nno bad behavior by anyone involved. \\n \\n It could be a different story for others in the future.  Imagine, if you will, one or more firms \\n(troubles often spread) with positions that are many multiples of ours attempting to liquidate in chaotic \\nmarkets and under extreme, and well-publicized, pressures.  This is a scenario to which much attention \\nshould be given now rather than after the fact.  The time to have considered \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and improved \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the reliability \\nof New Orleans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 levees was before Katrina. \\n \\n When we finally wind up Gen Re Securities, my feelings about its departure will be akin to those \\nexpressed in a country song, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy wife ran away with my best friend, and I sure miss him a lot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n</p>\\n<p> Below are the results of our various finance and financial products activities: \\n \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>(in $ millions) \\nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities \\n</p>\\n<p> 2005 2004 2005 2004 \\nTrading  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ordinary income ............................  $    200 $   264 $1,061 $5,751 \\nGen Re Securities (loss) .................................

That \\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change, moreover, because the deck is stacked against investors when it comes to the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pay.  \\nThe upshot is that a mediocre-or-worse CEO \\xe2\\x80\\x93 aided by his handpicked VP of human relations and a \\nconsultant from the ever-accommodating firm of Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all too often receives gobs \\nof money from an ill-designed compensation arrangement. \\n \\n Take, for instance, ten year, fixed-price options (and who wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t?).  If Fred Futile, CEO of \\nStagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of these \\xe2\\x80\\x93 let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say enough to give him an option on 1% of the company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nhis self-interest is clear: He should skip dividends entirely and instead use all of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings to \\nrepurchase stock. \\n \\n Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assume that under Fred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership Stagnant lives up to its name.  In each of the ten years \\nafter the option grant, it earns $1 billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to $10 per share \\non the 100 million shares then outstanding.  Fred eschews dividends and regularly uses all earnings to \\nrepurchase shares.  If the stock constantly sells at ten times earnings per share, it will have appreciated \\n158% by the end of the option period.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because repurchases would reduce the number of shares to \\n38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share would thereby increase to $25.80.  Simply by withholding \\nearnings from owners, Fred gets very rich, making a cool $158 million, despite the business itself \\nimproving not at all.  Astonishingly, Fred could have made more than $100 million if Stagnant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings \\nhad declined by 20% during the ten-year period. \\n \\n Fred can also get a splendid result for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings \\nhe withholds from shareholders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions.  Even if these \\ninitiatives deliver a paltry 5% return, Fred will still make a bundle.  Specifically \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with Stagnant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s p/e ratio \\nremaining unchanged at ten \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Fred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s option will deliver him $63 million.  Meanwhile, his shareholders will \\nwonder what happened to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9calignment of interests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that was supposed to occur when Fred was issued \\noptions. \\n \\n A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dividend policy, of course \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one-third of earnings paid out, for example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 produces \\nless extreme results but still can provide lush rewards for managers who achieve nothing. \\n \\n CEOs understand this math and know that every dime paid out in dividends reduces the value of \\nall outstanding options.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never, however, seen this manager-owner conflict referenced in proxy \\nmaterials that request approval of a fixed-priced option plan.  Though CEOs invariably preach internally \\nthat capital comes at a cost, they somehow forget to tell shareholders that fixed-price options give them \\ncapital that is free.  \\n \\n It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be this way: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s play for a board to design options that give effect to the \\nautomatic build-up in value that occurs when earnings are retained.  But \\xe2\\x80\\x93 surprise, surprise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 options of \\nthat kind are almost never issued.  Indeed, the very thought of options with strike prices that are adjusted \\nfor retained earnings seems foreign to compensation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexperts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who are nevertheless encyclopedic about \\nevery management-friendly plan that exists.  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) \\n \\n Getting fired can produce a particularly bountiful payday for a CEO.  Indeed, he can \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d more \\nin that single day, while cleaning out his desk, than an American worker earns in a lifetime of cleaning \\ntoilets.  Forget the old maxim about nothing succeeding like success: Today, in the executive suite, the all-\\ntoo-prevalent rule is that nothing succeeds like failure. \\n \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

My conviction, however, cost Berkshire $955 million pre-tax in 2005.  \\nThat amount is included in our earnings statement, a fact that illustrates the differing ways in which GAAP \\ntreats gains and losses.  When we have a long-term position in stocks or bonds, year-to-year changes in \\nvalue are reflected in our balance sheet but, as long as the asset is not sold, are rarely reflected in earnings.  \\nFor example, our Coca-Cola holdings went from $1 billion in value early on to $13.4 billion at yearend \\n1998 and have since declined to $8.1 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with none of these moves affecting our earnings statement.  \\nLong-term currency positions, however, are daily marked to market and therefore have an effect on \\nearnings in every reporting period.  From the date we first entered into currency contracts, we are $2.0 \\nbillion in the black. \\n \\n We reduced our direct position in currencies somewhat during 2005.  We partially offset this \\nchange, however, by purchasing equities whose prices are denominated in a variety of foreign currencies \\nand that earn a large part of their profits internationally.  Charlie and I prefer this method of acquiring non-\\ndollar exposure.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largely because of changes in interest rates: As U.S. rates have risen relative to \\nthose of the rest of the world, holding most foreign currencies now involves a significant negative \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\nThe carry aspect of our direct currency position indeed cost us money in 2005 and is likely to do so again in \\n2006.

Not only did our trade deficit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the largest and most familiar item in the current account \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hit an \\nall-time high in 2005, but we also can expect a second item \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the balance of investment income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to soon \\nturn negative.

       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>How to Minimize Investment Returns \\n \\n It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an easy matter for Berkshire and other owners of American equities to prosper over the \\nyears.  Between December 31, 1899 and December 31, 1999, to give a really long-term example, the Dow \\nrose from 66 to 11,497.  (Guess what annual growth rate is required to produce this result; the surprising \\nanswer is at the end of this section.)  This huge rise came about for a simple reason: Over the century \\nAmerican businesses did extraordinarily well and investors rode the wave of their prosperity.  Businesses \\ncontinue to do well.  But now shareholders, through a series of self-inflicted wounds, are in a major way \\ncutting the returns they will realize from their investments. \\n \\n The explanation of how this is happening begins with a fundamental truth: With unimportant \\nexceptions, such as bankruptcies in which some of a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s losses are borne by creditors, the most that \\nowners in aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their businesses in aggregate earn. \\nTrue, by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor A may take more than his share of the pie at the \\nexpense of investor B.  And, yes, all investors feel richer when stocks soar.  But an owner can exit only by \\nhaving someone take his place.  If one investor sells high, another must buy high.  For owners as a whole, \\nthere is simply no magic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no shower of money from outer space \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will enable them to extract wealth \\nfrom their companies beyond that created by the companies themselves. \\n \\n Indeed, owners must earn less than their businesses earn because of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrictional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d costs.  And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nmy point: These costs are now being incurred in amounts that will cause shareholders to earn far less than \\nthey historically have. \\n \\n To understand how this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all American corporations \\nare, and always will be, owned by a single family.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call them the Gotrocks.  After paying taxes on \\ndividends, this family \\xe2\\x80\\x93 generation after generation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its \\ncompanies.  Today that amount is about $700 billion annually.  Naturally, the family spends some of these \\ndollars.  But the portion it saves steadily compounds for its benefit.  In the Gotrocks household everyone \\ngrows wealthier at the same pace, and all is harmonious. \\n \\n But let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now assume that a few fast-talking Helpers approach the family and persuade each of its \\nmembers to try to outsmart his relatives by buying certain of their holdings and selling them certain others. \\nThe Helpers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for a fee, of course \\xe2\\x80\\x93 obligingly agree to handle these transactions.  The Gotrocks still own \\nall of corporate America; the trades just rearrange who owns what.  So the family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual gain in wealth \\ndiminishes, equaling the earnings of American business minus commissions paid.  The more that family \\nmembers trade, the smaller their share of the pie and the larger the slice received by the Helpers.  This fact \\nis not lost upon these broker-Helpers: Activity is their friend and, in a wide variety of ways, they urge it on. \\n \\n After a while, most of the family members realize that they are not doing so well at this new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeat-\\nmy-brother\\xe2\\x80\\x9d game.  Enter another set of Helpers.  These newcomers explain to each member of the \\nGotrocks clan that by himself he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never outsmart the rest of the family.  The suggested cure: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHire a \\nmanager \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yes, us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and get the job done professionally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  These manager-Helpers continue to use the \\nbroker-Helpers to execute trades; the managers may even increase their activity so as to permit the brokers \\nto prosper still more.  Overall, a bigger slice of the pie now goes to the two classes of Helpers. \\n \\n The family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disappointment grows.  Each of its members is now employing professionals.  Yet \\noverall, the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finances have taken a turn for the worse.  The solution?  More help, of course. \\n \\n It arrives in the form of financial planners and institutional consultants, who weigh in to advise the \\nGotrocks on selecting manager-Helpers.  The befuddled family welcomes this assistance.  By now its \\nmembers know they can pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers.  Why, one might ask, \\nshould they expect success in picking the right consultant?  But this question does not occur to the \\nGotrocks, and the consultant-Helpers certainly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suggest it to them. \\n \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> The Gotrocks, now supporting three classes of expensive Helpers, find that their results get worse, \\nand they sink into despair.  But just as hope seems lost, a fourth group \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call them the hyper-Helpers \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 appears.  These friendly folk explain to the Gotrocks that their unsatisfactory results are occurring \\nbecause the existing Helpers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 brokers, managers, consultants \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are not sufficiently motivated and are \\nsimply going through the motions.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the new Helpers ask, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan you expect from such a bunch of \\nzombies?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n The new arrivals offer a breathtakingly simple solution: Pay more money.  Brimming with self-\\nconfidence, the hyper-Helpers assert that huge contingent payments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in addition to stiff fixed fees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are \\nwhat each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuver his relatives. \\n \\n The more observant members of the family see that some of the hyper-Helpers are really just \\nmanager-Helpers wearing new uniforms, bearing sewn-on sexy names like HEDGE FUND or PRIVATE \\nEQUITY.  The new Helpers, however, assure the Gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important, \\nbestowing on its wearers magical powers similar to those acquired by mild-mannered Clark Kent when he \\nchanged into his Superman costume.  Calmed by this explanation, the family decides to pay up. \\n \\n And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where we are today: A record portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to \\nowners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if they all just stayed in their rocking chairs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is now going to a swelling army of Helpers.  \\nParticularly expensive is the recent pandemic of profit arrangements under which Helpers receive large \\nportions of the winnings when they are smart or lucky, and leave family members with all of the losses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nand large fixed fees to boot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when the Helpers are dumb or unlucky (or occasionally crooked). \\n \\n A sufficient number of arrangements like this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 heads, the Helper takes much of the winnings; \\ntails, the Gotrocks lose and pay dearly for the privilege of doing so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may make it more accurate to call the \\nfamily the Hadrocks.  Today, in fact, the family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frictional costs of all sorts may well amount to 20% of \\nthe earnings of American business.  In other words, the burden of paying Helpers may cause American \\nequity investors, overall, to earn only 80% or so of what they would earn if they just sat still and listened to \\nno one. \\n \\n Long ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius.  But Sir \\nIsaac\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talents didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can \\ncalculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  If he had not been traumatized by this \\nloss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole, \\nreturns decrease as motion increases. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section: To get very specific, the \\nDow increased from 65.73 to 11,497.12 in the 20th century, and that amounts to a gain of 5.3% \\ncompounded annually.  (Investors would also have received dividends, of course.)  To achieve an equal rate \\nof gain in the 21st century, the Dow will have to rise by December 31, 2099 to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 brace yourself \\xe2\\x80\\x93 precisely \\n2,011,011.23.  But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m willing to settle for 2,000,000; six years into this century, the Dow has gained not at \\nall. \\n \\nDebt and Risk \\n \\n As we consolidate MidAmerican, our new balance sheet may suggest that Berkshire has expanded \\nits tolerance for borrowing.  But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so.  Except for token amounts, we shun debt, turning to it for \\nonly three purposes: \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>1) We occasionally use repos as a part of certain short-term investing strategies that incorporate \\nownership of U.S. government (or agency) securities.  Purchases of this kind are highly \\nopportunistic and involve only the most liquid of securities.  A few years ago, we entered into \\nseveral interesting transactions that have since been unwound or are running off.  The offsetting \\ndebt has likewise been cut substantially and before long may be gone. \\n</p>\\n<p> 19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>2) We borrow money against portfolios of interest-bearing receivables whose risk characteristics we \\nunderstand.  We did this in 2001 when we guaranteed $5.6 billion of bank debt to take over, in \\npartnership with Leucadia, a bankrupt Finova (which held a broad range of receivables).  All of \\nthat debt has been repaid.  More recently, we have borrowed to finance a widely-diversified, \\npredictably-performing portfolio of manufactured-home receivables managed by Clayton.  \\nAlternatively, we could \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecuritize\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is, sell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these receivables, but retain the servicing of \\nthem.  If we followed this procedure, which is common in the industry, we would not show the \\ndebt that we do on our balance sheet, and we would also accelerate the earnings we report.  In the \\nend, however, we would earn less money.  Were market variables to change so as to favor \\nsecuritization (an unlikely event), we could sell part of our portfolio and eliminate the related debt.  \\nUntil then, we prefer better profits to better cosmetics. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n3) At MidAmerican, we have substantial debt, but it is that company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obligation only.  Though it \\n</p>\\n<p>will appear on our consolidated balance sheet, Berkshire does not guarantee it. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Even so, this debt is unquestionably secure because it is serviced by MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diversified \\nstream of highly-stable utility earnings.  If there were to be some bolt from the blue that hurt one \\nof MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s utility properties, earnings from the others would still be more than ample to \\ncover all debt requirements.  Moreover, MidAmerican retains all of its earnings, an equity-\\nbuilding practice that is rare in the utility field. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n From a risk standpoint, it is far safer to have earnings from ten diverse and uncorrelated utility \\n</p>\\n<p>operations that cover interest charges by, say, a 2:1 ratio than it is to have far greater coverage \\nprovided by a single utility.  A catastrophic event can render a single utility insolvent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 witness \\nwhat Katrina did to the local electric utility in New Orleans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no matter how conservative its debt \\npolicy.  A geographical disaster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 say, an earthquake in a Western state \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the same \\neffect on MidAmerican.  And even a worrier like Charlie can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of an event that would \\nsystemically decrease utility earnings in any major way.  Because of MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever-\\nwidening diversity of regulated earnings, it will always utilize major amounts of debt. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about it.  We are not interested in incurring any significant debt at Berkshire for \\nacquisitions or operating purposes.  Conventional business wisdom, of course, would argue that we are \\nbeing too conservative and that there are added profits that could be safely earned if we injected moderate \\nleverage into our balance sheet. \\n \\n Maybe so.  But many of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hundreds of thousands of investors have a large portion of \\ntheir net worth in our stock (among them, it should be emphasized, a large number of our board and key \\nmanagers) and a disaster for the company would be a disaster for them.  Moreover, there are people who \\nhave been permanently injured to whom we owe insurance payments that stretch out for fifty years or \\nmore.  To these and other constituencies we have promised total security, whatever comes: financial panics, \\nstock-exchange closures (an extended one occurred in 1914) or even domestic nuclear, chemical or \\nbiological attacks. \\n \\n We are quite willing to accept huge risks.  Indeed, more than any other insurer, we write high-limit \\npolicies that are tied to single catastrophic events.  We also own a large investment portfolio whose market \\nvalue could fall dramatically and quickly under certain conditions (as happened on October 19, 1987).  \\nWhatever occurs, though, Berkshire will have the net worth, the earnings streams and the liquidity to \\nhandle the problem with ease. \\n \\n Any other approach is dangerous.  Over the years, a number of very smart people have learned the \\nhard way that a long string of impressive numbers multiplied by a single zero always equals zero.  That is \\nnot an equation whose effects I would like to experience personally, and I would like even less to be \\nresponsible for imposing its penalties upon others. \\n \\n \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Management Succession \\n \\n As owners, you are naturally concerned about whether I will insist on continuing as CEO after I \\nbegin to fade and, if so, how the board will handle that problem.  You also want to know what happens if I \\nshould die tonight. \\n \\n That second question is easy to answer.  Most of our many businesses have strong market \\npositions, significant momentum, and terrific managers.  The special Berkshire culture is deeply ingrained \\nthroughout our subsidiaries, and these operations won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t miss a beat when I die. \\n \\n Moreover, we have three managers at Berkshire who are reasonably young and fully capable of \\nbeing CEO.  Any of the three would be much better at certain management aspects of my job than I.  On \\nthe minus side, none has my crossover experience that allows me to be comfortable making decisions in \\neither the business arena or in investments.  That problem will be solved by having another person in the \\norganization handle marketable securities.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an interesting job at Berkshire, and the new CEO will \\nhave no problem in hiring a talented individual to do it.  Indeed, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we have done at GEICO for 26 \\nyears, and our results have been terrific. \\n \\n Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s board has fully discussed each of the three CEO candidates and has unanimously \\nagreed on the person who should succeed me if a replacement were needed today.  The directors stay \\nupdated on this subject and could alter their view as circumstances change \\xe2\\x80\\x93 new managerial stars may \\nemerge and present ones will age.  The important point is that the directors know now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and will always \\nknow in the future \\xe2\\x80\\x93 exactly what they will do when the need arises. \\n \\n The other question that must be addressed is whether the Board will be prepared to make a change \\nif that need should arise not from my death but rather from my decay, particularly if this decay is \\naccompanied by my delusionally thinking that I am reaching new peaks of managerial brilliance.  That \\nproblem would not be unique to me.  Charlie and I have faced this situation from time to time at \\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subsidiaries.  Humans age at greatly varying rates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but sooner or later their talents and vigor \\ndecline.  Some managers remain effective well into their 80s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Charlie is a wonder at 82 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and others \\nnoticeably fade in their 60s.  When their abilities ebb, so usually do their powers of self-assessment.  \\nSomeone else often needs to blow the whistle. \\n \\n When that time comes for me, our board will have to step up to the job.  From a financial \\nstandpoint, its members are unusually motivated to do so.  I know of no other board in the country in which \\nthe financial interests of directors are so completely aligned with those of shareholders.  Few boards even \\ncome close.  On a personal level, however, it is extraordinarily difficult for most people to tell someone, \\nparticularly a friend, that he or she is no longer capable. \\n \\n If I become a candidate for that message, however, our board will be doing me a favor by \\ndelivering it.  Every share of Berkshire that I own is destined to go to philanthropies, and I want society to \\nreap the maximum good from these gifts and bequests.  It would be a tragedy if the philanthropic potential \\nof my holdings was diminished because my associates shirked their responsibility to (tenderly, I hope) \\nshow me the door.  But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about this.  We have an outstanding group of directors, and they will \\nalways do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right for shareholders. \\n \\n And while we are on the subject, I feel terrific. \\n \\nThe Annual Meeting \\n \\n Our meeting this year will be on Saturday, May 6.  As always, the doors will open at the Qwest \\nCenter at 7 a.m., and the latest Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to the \\nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stands) will last until 3:00.  Then, \\nafter a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.

The 194,300 square foot hall adjoining the \\nmeeting area was filled with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries, and the 21,000 people who came to the \\nmeeting allowed every location to rack up sales records.  Kelly Broz (ne\\xc3\\xa9 Muchemore), the Flo Ziegfeld of \\nBerkshire, orchestrates both this magnificent shopping extravaganza and the meeting itself.  The exhibitors \\nlove her, and so do I.  Kelly got married in October, and I gave her away.  She asked me how I wanted to \\nbe listed in the wedding program.  I replied \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenvious of the groom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it went to press. \\n \\n This year we will showcase two Clayton homes (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \\nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that these \\nhomes, priced at $79,000 and $89,000, deliver excellent value.  In fact, three shareholders came so firmly \\nto that conclusion last year that they bought the $119,000 model we then showcased.  Flanking the Clayton \\nhomes on the exhibition floor will be RVs from Forest River. \\n \\n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \\nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \\nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \\nyou money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.  And while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \\ncredit card.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one I now use. \\n \\n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets\\xc2\\xae \\navailable for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  \\nCome to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane. \\n \\n The Bookworm boutique at the Qwest broke all records last year selling Berkshire-related books.  \\nAn amazing 3,500 of these were Poor Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Almanack, the collected wisdom of my partner.  This \\nmeans that a copy was sold every 9 seconds.  And for good reason: You will never find a book with more \\nuseful ideas.  Word-of-mouth recommendations have caused Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first printing of 20,500 copies to sell \\nout, and we will therefore have a revised and expanded edition on sale at our meeting.  Among the other 22 \\ntitles and DVDs available last year at the Bookworm, 4,597 copies were sold for $84,746.  Our \\nshareholders are a bookseller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream. \\n \\n An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \\nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. \\n \\n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \\nwe will again be having \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM nine years \\nago, and sales during the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $27.4 million in 2005 (up 9% from \\na year earlier).  I get goose bumps just thinking about this volume. \\n \\n To obtain the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 4 and Monday,  \\nMay 8 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will even apply to \\nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but \\nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their \\ncooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on \\nSunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we are having a special affair for shareholders \\nonly.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be there, eating barbeque, drinking Coke, and counting sales. \\n \\n Borsheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s again will have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception \\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 5.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on \\nSunday, May 7.

Last year, our shareholder-period business increased 9% \\nfrom 2004, which came on top of a 73% gain the year before.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> \\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n \\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2006 was $16.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 18.4%.  Over the last 42 years (that is, since present management \\ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $70,281, a rate of 21.4% compounded annually.* \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>We believe that $16.9 billion is a record for a one-year gain in net worth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more than has ever \\nbeen booked by any American business, leaving aside boosts that have occurred because of mergers (e.g., \\nAOL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purchase of Time Warner).  Of course, Exxon Mobil and other companies earn far more than \\nBerkshire, but their earnings largely go to dividends and/or repurchases, rather than to building net worth. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nAll that said, a confession about our 2006 gain is in order.  Our most important business, \\n</p>\\n<p>insurance, benefited from a large dose of luck:  Mother Nature, bless her heart, went on vacation.  After \\nhammering us with hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 storms that caused us to lose a bundle on super-cat \\ninsurance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she just vanished.  Last year, the red ink from this activity turned black \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very black. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nIn addition, the great majority of our 73 businesses did outstandingly well in 2006.  Let me focus \\n</p>\\n<p>for a moment on one of our largest operations, GEICO.  What management accomplished there was simply \\nextraordinary. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nAs I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve told you before, Tony Nicely, GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, went to work at the company 45 years ago, \\n</p>\\n<p>two months after turning 18.  He became CEO in 1992, and from then on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth exploded.  \\nIn addition, Tony has delivered staggering productivity gains in recent years.  Between yearend 2003 and \\nyearend 2006, the number of GEICO policies increased from 5.7 million to 8.1 million, a jump of 42%.  \\nYet during that same period, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employees (measured on a fulltime-equivalent basis) fell 3.5%.  \\nSo productivity grew 47%.  And GEICO didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start fat. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nThat remarkable gain has allowed GEICO to maintain its all-important position as a low-cost \\n</p>\\n<p>producer, even though it has dramatically increased advertising expenditures.  Last year GEICO spent $631 \\nmillion on ads, up from $238 million in 2003 (and up from $31 million in 1995, when Berkshire took \\ncontrol).  Today, GEICO spends far more on ads than any of its competitors, even those much larger.  We \\nwill continue to raise the bar. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nLast year I told you that if you had a new son or grandson to be sure to name him Tony.  But Don \\n</p>\\n<p>Keough, a Berkshire director, recently had a better idea.  After reviewing GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance in 2006, \\nhe wrote me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForget births.  Tell the shareholders to immediately change the names of their present \\nchildren to Tony or Antoinette.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Don signed his letter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTony.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\nCharlie Munger \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my partner and Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice chairman \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I run what has turned out to be \\n</p>\\n<p>a big business, one with 217,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $100 billion.  We certainly \\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t plan it that way.  Charlie began as a lawyer, and I thought of myself as a security analyst.  Sitting in \\nthose seats, we both grew skeptical about the ability of big entities of any type to function well.  Size seems \\nto make many organizations slow-thinking, resistant to change and smug.  In Churchill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shape \\nour buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a telling fact: Of the ten non-oil companies \\nhaving the largest market capitalization in 1965 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 titans such as General Motors, Sears, DuPont and \\nEastman Kodak \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only one made the 2006 list.   \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n  \\n *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In fairness, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen plenty of successes as well, some truly outstanding.  There are many giant-\\ncompany managers whom I greatly admire; Ken Chenault of American Express, Jeff Immelt of G.E. and \\nDick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo come quickly to mind.  But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I could do the management job \\nthey do.  And I know I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enjoy many of the duties that come with their positions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meetings, \\nspeeches, foreign travel, the charity circuit and governmental relations.  For me, Ronald Reagan had it \\nright: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably true that hard work never killed anyone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but why take the chance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken the easy route, just sitting back and working through great managers who run their \\n</p>\\n<p>own shows.  My only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt and harden our corporate culture, and make major \\ncapital-allocation decisions.  Our managers have returned this trust by working hard and effectively. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nFor their performance over the last 42 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and particularly for 2006 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Charlie and I thank \\n</p>\\n<p>them. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Yardsticks \\n \\n Charlie and I measure Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress and evaluate its intrinsic value in a number of ways. \\nNo single criterion is effective in doing these jobs, and even an avalanche of statistics will not capture some \\nfactors that are important.  For example, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s essential that we have managers much younger than I available \\nto succeed me.  Berkshire has never been in better shape in this regard \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prove it to you with \\nnumbers. \\n \\n There are two statistics, however, that are of real importance.  The first is the amount of \\ninvestments (including cash and cash-equivalents) that we own on a per-share basis.  Arriving at this figure, \\nwe exclude investments held in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings.  \\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the record since present management acquired control of Berkshire: \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nYear\\n</p>\\n<p> \\nPer-Share Investments* \\n</p>\\n<p>  \\n1965 ..................................................................... $         4 \\n1975 ..................................................................... 159 \\n1985 ..................................................................... 2,407 \\n1995 ..................................................................... 21,817 \\n2006 ..................................................................... $80,636\\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006....................        27.5% \\nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006....................        12.6% \\n</p>\\n<p>  *Net of minority interests \\n \\n In our early years we put most of our retained earnings and insurance float into investments in \\nmarketable securities.  Because of this emphasis, and because the securities we purchased generally did \\nwell, our growth rate in investments was for a long time quite high. \\n \\n Over the years, however, we have focused more and more on the acquisition of operating \\nbusinesses.

Large gains from here on in, \\nthough, will come only if we are able to make major, and sensible, acquisitions.  That will not be easy.  We \\ndo, however, have one advantage: More and more, Berkshire has become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe buyer of choice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for \\nbusiness owners and managers.  Initially, we were viewed that way only in the U.S. (and more often than \\nnot by private companies).  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve long wanted, nonetheless, to extend Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal beyond U.S. \\nborders.  And last year, our globe-trotting finally got underway. \\n \\nAcquisitions \\n \\n We began 2006 by completing the three acquisitions pending at yearend 2005, spending about $6 \\nbillion for PacifiCorp, Business Wire and Applied Underwriters.  All are performing very well. \\n \\n The highlight of the year, however, was our July 5th acquisition of most of ISCAR, an Israeli \\ncompany, and our new association with its chairman, Eitan Wertheimer, and CEO, Jacob Harpaz.  The \\nstory here began on October 25, 2005, when I received a 1\\xc2\\xbc-page letter from Eitan, of whom I then knew \\nnothing.  The letter began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am writing to introduce you to ISCAR,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and proceeded to describe a cutting-\\ntool business carried on in 61 countries.  Then Eitan wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have for some time considered the issues \\nof generational transfer and ownership that are typical for large family enterprises, and have given much \\nthought to ISCAR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future.  Our conclusion is that Berkshire Hathaway would be the ideal home for \\nISCAR.  We believe that ISCAR would continue to thrive as a part of your portfolio of businesses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, Eitan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter made the quality of the company and the character of its management leap \\noff the page.  It also made me want to learn more, and in November, Eitan, Jacob and ISCAR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CFO, \\nDanny Goldman, came to Omaha.  A few hours with them convinced me that if we were to make a deal, we \\nwould be teaming up with extraordinarily talented managers who could be trusted to run the business after \\na sale with all of the energy and dedication that they had exhibited previously.  However, having never \\nbought a business based outside of the U.S. (though I had bought a number of foreign stocks), I needed to \\nget educated on some tax and jurisdictional matters.  With that task completed, Berkshire purchased 80% of \\nISCAR for $4 billion.

       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> In September, Charlie and I, along with five Berkshire associates, visited ISCAR in Israel.  We \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nand I mean every one of us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have never been more impressed with any operation.  At ISCAR, as \\nthroughout Israel, brains and energy are ubiquitous.  Berkshire shareholders are lucky to have joined with \\nEitan, Jacob, Danny and their talented associates. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n A few months later, Berkshire again became \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe buyer of choice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a deal brought to us by my \\nfriend, John Roach, of Fort Worth.  John, many of you will remember, was Chairman of Justin Industries, \\nwhich we bought in 2000.  At that time John was helping John Justin, who was terminally ill, find a \\npermanent home for his company.  John Justin died soon after we bought Justin Industries, but it has since \\nbeen run exactly as we promised him it would be. \\n \\n Visiting me in November, John Roach brought along Paul Andrews, Jr., owner of about 80% of \\nTTI, a Fort Worth distributor of electronic components.  Over a 35-year period, Paul built TTI from \\n$112,000 of sales to $1.3 billion.  He is a remarkable entrepreneur and operator. \\n \\n Paul, 64, loves running his business.  But not long ago he happened to witness how disruptive the \\ndeath of a founder can be both to a private company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employees and the owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family.  What starts out \\nas disruptive, furthermore, often evolves into destructive.  About a year ago, therefore, Paul began to think \\nabout selling TTI.  His goal was to put his business in the hands of an owner he had carefully chosen, rather \\nthan allowing a trust officer or lawyer to conduct an auction after his death. \\n \\n Paul rejected the idea of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrategic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d buyer, knowing that in the pursuit of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csynergies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an owner \\nof that type would be apt to dismantle what he had so carefully built, a move that would uproot hundreds of \\nhis associates (and perhaps wound TTI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business in the process).  He also ruled out a private equity firm, \\nwhich would very likely load the company with debt and then flip it as soon as possible. \\n \\n That left Berkshire.  Paul and I met on the morning of November 15th and made a deal before \\nlunch.  Later he wrote me: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter our meeting, I am confident that Berkshire is the right owner for TTI . . . \\nI am proud of our past and excited about our future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  And so are Charlie and I. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n We also made some \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctuck-in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquisitions during 2006 at Fruit of the Loom (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFruit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), MiTek, \\nCTB, Shaw and Clayton.  Fruit made the largest purchases.  First, it bought Russell Corp., a leading \\nproducer of athletic apparel and uniforms for about $1.2 billion (including assumed debt) and in December \\nit agreed to buy the intimate apparel business of VF Corp.  Together, these acquisitions add about $2.2 \\nbillion to Fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales and bring with them about 23,000 employees. \\n \\n Charlie and I love it when we can acquire businesses that can be placed under managers, such as \\nJohn Holland at Fruit, who have already shown their stuff at Berkshire.  MiTek, for example, has made 14 \\nacquisitions since we purchased it in 2001, and Gene Toombs has delivered results from these deals far in \\nexcess of what he had predicted.  In effect, we leverage the managerial talent already with us by these tuck-\\nin deals.  We will make many more. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n We continue, however, to need \\xe2\\x80\\x9celephants\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in order for us to use Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flood of incoming \\ncash.

Lumping their financial figures \\ntogether impedes analysis.  So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look at them as four separate businesses, starting with the all\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nimportant insurance group. \\n \\nInsurance \\n \\n Next month marks the 40th anniversary of our entrance into the insurance business.  It was on \\nMarch 9, 1967, that Berkshire purchased National Indemnity and its companion company, National Fire &amp; \\nMarine, from Jack Ringwalt for $8.6 million. \\n \\n Jack was a long-time friend of mine and an excellent, but somewhat eccentric, businessman.  For \\nabout ten minutes every year he would get the urge to sell his company.  But those moods \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps \\nbrought on by a tiff with regulators or an unfavorable jury verdict \\xe2\\x80\\x93 quickly vanished. \\n \\n In the mid-1960s, I asked investment banker Charlie Heider, a mutual friend of mine and Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, \\nto alert me the next time Jack was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin heat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  When Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call came, I sped to meet Jack.  We made a \\ndeal in a few minutes, with me waiving an audit, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdue diligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or anything else that would give Jack an \\nopportunity to reconsider.  We just shook hands, and that was that. \\n \\n When we were due to close the purchase at Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, Jack was late.  Finally arriving, he \\nexplained that he had been driving around looking for a parking meter with some unexpired time.  That was \\na magic moment for me.  I knew then that Jack was going to be my kind of manager. \\n \\n When Berkshire purchased Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two insurers, they had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of $17 million.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve regularly \\noffered a long explanation of float in earlier reports, which you can read on our website.  Simply put, float \\nis money we hold that is not ours but which we get to invest. \\n \\n At the end of 2006, our float had grown to $50.9 billion, and we have since written a huge \\nretroactive reinsurance contract with Equitas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which I will describe in the next section \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that boosts float \\nby another $7 billion.  Much of the gain we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made has come through our acquisition of other insurers, \\nbut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also had outstanding internal growth, particularly at Ajit Jain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing reinsurance operation.  \\nNaturally, I had no notion in 1967 that our float would develop as it has.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much to be said for just \\nputting one foot in front of the other every day. \\n \\n The float from retroactive reinsurance contracts, of which we have many, automatically drifts \\ndown over time.  Therefore, it will be difficult for us to increase float in the future unless we make new \\nacquisitions in the insurance field.  Whatever its size, however, the all-important cost of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float \\nover time is likely to be significantly below that of the industry, perhaps even falling to less than zero.  \\nNote the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cover time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  There will be bad years periodically.  You can be sure of that. \\n \\n In 2006, though, everything went right in insurance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 really right.  Our managers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tony Nicely \\n(GEICO), Ajit Jain (B-H Reinsurance), Joe Brandon and Tad Montross (General Re), Don Wurster \\n(National Indemnity Primary), Tom Nerney (U.S. Liability), Tim Kenesey (Medical Protective), Rod \\nEldred (Homestate Companies and Cypress), Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies (Applied Underwriters), John \\nKizer (Central States) and Don Towle (Kansas Bankers Surety) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 simply shot the lights out.  When I recite \\ntheir names, I feel as if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at Cooperstown, reading from the Hall of Fame roster.  Of course, the overall \\ninsurance industry also had a terrific year in 2006.  But our managers delivered results generally superior to \\nthose of their competitors. \\n</p>\\n<p> 7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The big unknown is super-cat insurance.  Were the terrible hurricane seasons \\nof 2004-05 aberrations?  Or were they our planet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first warning that the climate of the 21st Century will \\ndiffer materially from what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in the past?  If the answer to the second question is yes, 2006 will \\nsoon be perceived as a misleading period of calm preceding a series of devastating storms.  These could \\nrock the insurance industry.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s na\\xc3\\xafve to think of Katrina as anything close to a worst-case event. \\n \\n Neither Ajit Jain, who manages our super-cat operation, nor I know what lies ahead.  We do know \\nthat it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications \\nfor insurers. \\n \\n Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think, however, that we have lost our taste for risk.  We remain prepared to lose $6 billion \\nin a single event, if we have been paid appropriately for assuming that risk.  We are not willing, though, to \\ntake on even very small exposures at prices that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities.  \\nAppropriate prices don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee profits in any given year, but inappropriate prices most certainly \\nguarantee eventual losses.  Rates have recently fallen because a flood of capital has entered the super-cat \\nfield.  We have therefore sharply reduced our wind exposures.  Our behavior here parallels that which we \\nemploy in financial markets: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. \\n \\nLloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Equitas and Retroactive Reinsurance \\n \\n Last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are getting now to Equitas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire agreed to enter into a huge retroactive \\nreinsurance contract, a policy that protects an insurer against losses that have already happened, but whose \\ncost is not yet known.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you details of the agreement shortly.  But let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first take a journey through \\ninsurance history, following the route that led to our deal. \\n \\n Our tale begins around 1688, when Edward Lloyd opened a small coffee house in London.  \\nThough no Starbucks, his shop was destined to achieve worldwide fame because of the commercial \\nactivities of its clientele \\xe2\\x80\\x93 shipowners, merchants and venturesome British capitalists.  As these parties \\nsipped Edward\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brew, they began to write contracts transferring the risk of a disaster at sea from the \\nowners of ships and their cargo to the capitalists, who wagered that a given voyage would be completed \\nwithout incident.  These capitalists eventually became known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderwriters at Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n Though many people believe Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to be an insurance company, that is not the case.  It is \\ninstead a place where many member-insurers transact business, just as they did centuries ago. \\n \\n Over time, the underwriters solicited passive investors to join in syndicates.  Additionally, the \\nbusiness broadened beyond marine risks into every imaginable form of insurance, including exotic \\ncoverages that spread the fame of Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far and wide.  The underwriters left the coffee house, found \\ngrander quarters and formalized some rules of association.  And those persons who passively backed the \\nunderwriters became known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnames.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p> 8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Eventually, the names came to include many thousands of people from around the world, who \\njoined expecting to pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk.  True, prospective names were \\nalways solemnly told that they would have unlimited and everlasting liability for the consequences of their \\nsyndicate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdown to the last cufflink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the quaint description went.  But that warning \\ncame to be viewed as perfunctory.  Three hundred years of retained cufflinks acted as a powerful sedative \\nto the names poised to sign up. \\n \\n Then came asbestos.  When its prospective costs were added to the tidal wave of environmental \\nand product claims that surfaced in the 1980s, Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s began to implode.  Policies written decades earlier \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nand largely forgotten about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were developing huge losses.  No one could intelligently estimate their total, \\nbut it was certain to be many tens of billions of dollars.  The specter of unending and unlimited losses \\nterrified existing names and scared away prospects.  Many names opted for bankruptcy; some even chose \\nsuicide. \\n \\n From these shambles, there came a desperate effort to resuscitate Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  In 1996, the powers \\nthat be at the institution allotted \\xc2\\xa311.1 billion to a new company, Equitas, and made it responsible for \\npaying all claims on policies written before 1993.  In effect, this plan pooled the misery of the many \\nsyndicates in trouble.  Of course, the money allotted could prove to be insufficient \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and if that happened, \\nthe names remained liable for the shortfall. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>But the new plan, by concentrating all of the liabilities in one place, had the advantage of \\neliminating much of the costly intramural squabbling that went on among syndicates.  Moreover, the \\npooling allowed claims evaluation, negotiation and litigation to be handled more intelligently than had been \\nthe case previously.  Equitas embraced Ben Franklin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinking: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must all hang together, or assuredly \\nwe shall hang separately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\n \\n From the start, many people predicted Equitas would eventually fail.  But as Ajit and I reviewed \\nthe facts in the spring of 2006 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 13 years after the last exposed policy had been written and after the \\npayment of \\xc2\\xa311.3 billion in claims \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we concluded that the patient was likely to survive.  And so we \\ndecided to offer a huge reinsurance policy to Equitas. \\n \\n Because plenty of imponderables continue to exist, Berkshire could not provide Equitas, and its \\n27,972 names, unlimited protection.  But we said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m simplifying \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that if Equitas would give us \\n$7.12 billion in cash and securities (this is the float I spoke about), we would pay all of its future claims and \\nexpenses up to $13.9 billion.  That amount was $5.7 billion above what Equitas had recently guessed its \\nultimate liabilities to be.  Thus the names received a huge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and almost certainly sufficient \\xe2\\x80\\x93 amount of \\nfuture protection against unpleasant surprises.  Indeed the protection is so large that Equitas plans a cash \\npayment to its thousands of names, an event few of them had ever dreamed possible. \\n \\n And how will Berkshire fare?  That depends on how much \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d claims will end up costing us, \\nhow many yet-to-be-presented claims will surface and what they will cost, how soon claim payments will \\nbe made and how much we earn on the cash we receive before it must be paid out.  Ajit and I think the odds \\nare in our favor.  And should we be wrong, Berkshire can handle it. \\n \\n Scott Moser, the CEO of Equitas, summarized the transaction neatly: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNames wanted to sleep \\neasy at night, and we think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just bought them the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best mattress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * \\nWarning: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to eat your broccoli \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I am now going to talk about accounting matters.  I owe \\n</p>\\n<p>this to those Berkshire shareholders who love reading about debits and credits.  I hope both of you find this \\ndiscussion helpful.  All others can skip this section; there will be no quiz. \\n \\n Berkshire has done many retroactive transactions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in both number and amount a multiple of such \\npolicies entered into by any other insurer.  We are the reinsurer of choice for these coverages because the \\nobligations that are transferred to us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example, lifetime indemnity and medical payments to be made to \\ninjured workers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may not be fully satisfied for 50 years or more.  No other company can offer the certainty  \\n</p>\\n<p> 9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>that Berkshire can, in terms of guaranteeing the full and fair settlement of these obligations.  This fact is \\nimportant to the original insurer, policyholders and regulators. \\n \\n The accounting procedure for retroactive transactions is neither well known nor intuitive.  The \\nbest way for shareholders to understand it, therefore, is for us to simply lay out the debits and credits.  \\nCharlie and I would like to see this done more often.  We sometimes encounter accounting footnotes about \\nimportant transactions that leave us baffled, and we go away suspicious that the reporting company wished \\nit that way.  (For example, try comprehending transactions \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdescribed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the old 10-Ks of Enron, even \\nafter you know how the movie ended.) \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>So let us summarize our accounting for the Equitas transaction.  The major debits will be to Cash \\nand Investments, Reinsurance Recoverable, and Deferred Charges for Reinsurance Assumed (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  \\nThe major credit will be to Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense.  No profit or loss will be \\nrecorded at the inception of the transaction, but underwriting losses will thereafter be incurred annually as \\nthe DCRA asset is amortized downward.  The amount of the annual amortization charge will be primarily \\ndetermined by how our end-of-the-year estimates as to the timing and amount of future loss payments \\ncompare to the estimates made at the beginning of the year.  Eventually, when the last claim has been paid, \\nthe DCRA account will be reduced to zero.  That day is 50 years or more away. \\n \\n What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to remember is that retroactive insurance contracts always produce underwriting \\nlosses for us.  Whether these losses are worth experiencing depends on whether the cash we have received \\nproduces investment income that exceeds the losses.  Recently our DCRA charges have annually delivered \\n$300 million or so of underwriting losses, which have been more than offset by the income we have \\nrealized through use of the cash we received as a premium.  Absent new retroactive contracts, the amount \\nof the annual charge would normally decline over time.  After the Equitas transaction, however, the annual \\nDCRA cost will initially increase to about $450 million a year.  This means that our other insurance \\noperations must generate at least that much underwriting gain for our overall float to be cost-free.  That \\namount is quite a hurdle but one that I believe we will clear in many, if not most, years. \\n \\n Aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you glad that I promised you there would be no quiz? \\n \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \\n \\n Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

When an industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underlying \\neconomics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline.  Eventually, though, \\neroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance.  (As a wise friend told me long ago, \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want to get a reputation as a good businessman, be sure to get into a good business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)  And \\nfundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry, a trend that has caused the profits \\nof our Buffalo News to decline.  The skid will almost certainly continue. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nWhen Charlie and I were young, the newspaper business was as easy a way to make huge returns \\nas existed in America.  As one not-too-bright publisher famously said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI owe my fortune to two \\ngreat American institutions: monopoly and nepotism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  No paper in a one-paper city, however bad \\nthe product or however inept the management, could avoid gushing profits. \\n \\nThe industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staggering returns could be simply explained.  For most of the 20th Century, \\nnewspapers were the primary source of information for the American public.  Whether the subject \\nwas sports, finance, or politics, newspapers reigned supreme.  Just as important, their ads were the \\neasiest way to find job opportunities or to learn the price of groceries at your town\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supermarkets.   \\n</p>\\n<p> 11</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The great majority of families therefore felt the need for a paper every day, but understandably \\nmost didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wish to pay for two.  Advertisers preferred the paper with the most circulation, and \\nreaders tended to want the paper with the most ads and news pages.  This circularity led to a law \\nof the newspaper jungle: Survival of the Fattest.  \\n \\nThus, when two or more papers existed in a major city (which was almost universally the case a \\ncentury ago), the one that pulled ahead usually emerged as the stand-alone winner.  After \\ncompetition disappeared, the paper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pricing power in both advertising and circulation was \\nunleashed.  Typically, rates for both advertisers and readers would be raised annually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the \\nprofits rolled in.  For owners this was economic heaven.  (Interestingly, though papers regularly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nand often in a disapproving way \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reported on the profitability of, say, the auto or steel industries, \\nthey never enlightened readers about their own Midas-like situation.  Hmmm . . .) \\n \\nAs long ago as my 1991 letter to shareholders, I nonetheless asserted that this insulated world was \\nchanging, writing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe media businesses . . . will prove considerably less marvelous than I, the \\nindustry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Some publishers took \\numbrage at both this remark and other warnings from me that followed.  Newspaper properties, \\nmoreover, continued to sell as if they were indestructible slot machines.  In fact, many intelligent \\nnewspaper executives who regularly chronicled and analyzed important worldwide events were \\neither blind or indifferent to what was going on under their noses.  \\n \\nNow, however, almost all newspaper owners realize that they are constantly losing ground in the \\nbattle for eyeballs.  Simply put, if cable and satellite broadcasting, as well as the internet, had \\ncome along first, newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nIn Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world, Stan Lipsey does a terrific job running the Buffalo News, and I am \\nenormously proud of its editor, Margaret Sullivan.  The News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 penetration of its market is the \\nhighest among that of this country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s large newspapers.  We also do better financially than most \\nmetropolitan newspapers, even though Buffalo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population and business trends are not good.  \\nNevertheless, this operation faces unrelenting pressures that will cause profit margins to slide. \\n \\nTrue, we have the leading online news operation in Buffalo, and it will continue to attract more \\nviewers and ads.  However, the economic potential of a newspaper internet site \\xe2\\x80\\x93 given the many \\nalternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is at best \\na small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition. \\n \\nFor a local resident, ownership of a city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paper, like ownership of a sports team, still produces \\ninstant prominence.  With it typically comes power and influence.  These are ruboffs that appeal to \\nmany people with money.  Beyond that, civic-minded, wealthy individuals may feel that local \\nownership will serve their community well. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why Peter Kiewit bought the Omaha paper \\nmore than 40 years ago. \\n \\nWe are likely therefore to see non-economic individual buyers of newspapers emerge, just as we \\nhave seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises.  Aspiring press lords should be careful, \\nhowever: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no rule that says a newspaper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenues can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fall below its expenses and that \\nlosses can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mushroom.  Fixed costs are high in the newspaper business, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad news when \\nunit volume heads south.  As the importance of newspapers diminishes, moreover, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpsychic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\nvalue of possessing one will wane, whereas owning a sports franchise will likely retain its cachet. \\n \\nUnless we face an irreversible cash drain, we will stick with the News, just as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said that we \\nwould.  (Read economic principle 11, on page 76.)  Charlie and I love newspapers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we each read \\nfive a day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and believe that a free and energetic press is a key ingredient for maintaining a great \\ndemocracy.  We hope that some combination of print and online will ward off economic \\ndoomsday for newspapers, and we will work hard in Buffalo to develop a sustainable business \\nmodel.  I think we will be successful.  But the days of lush profits from our newspaper are over. \\n</p>\\n<p> 12</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

This company has never had a problem growing: Revenues from flight operations have \\nincreased 596% since our purchase in 1998.  But profits had been erratic. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nOur move to Europe, which began in 1996, was particularly expensive.  After five years of \\noperation there, we had acquired only 80 customers.  And by mid-year 2006 our cumulative pre-\\ntax loss had risen to $212 million.  But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 \\ncustomers having been added in 2005-2006.  Under Mark Booth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brilliant leadership, NetJets is \\nnow operating profitably in Europe, and we expect the positive trend to continue. \\n \\nOur U.S. operation also had a good year in 2006, which led to worldwide pre-tax earnings of $143 \\nmillion at NetJets last year.  We made this profit even though we suffered a loss of $19 million in \\nthe first quarter. \\n \\nCredit Rich Santulli, along with Mark, for this turnaround.  Rich, like many of our managers, has \\nno financial need to work.  But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never know it.  He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absolutely tireless \\xe2\\x80\\x93 monitoring \\noperations, making sales, and traveling the globe to constantly widen the already-enormous lead \\nthat NetJets enjoys over its competitors.  Today, the value of the fleet we manage is far greater \\nthan that managed by our three largest competitors combined. \\n \\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reason NetJets is the runaway leader: It offers the ultimate in safety and service.  At \\nBerkshire, and at a number of our subsidiaries, NetJets aircraft are an indispensable business tool.  \\nI also have a contract for personal use with NetJets and so do members of my family and most \\nBerkshire directors.  (None of us, I should add, gets a discount.)  Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve flown NetJets, \\nreturning to commercial flights is like going back to holding hands. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nRegulated Utility Business \\n \\n Berkshire has an 86.6% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a \\nwide variety of utility operations.  The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, \\nwhose 3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) \\nMidAmerican Energy, which serves 706,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and \\nRocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern \\nRiver and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave \\nSokol and Greg Abel.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will make major moves only \\nwhen we are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Six years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have \\nunderscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have better partners. \\n \\n Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the \\nU.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 20,300 \\nagents.  Despite HomeServices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 purchase of two operations last year, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall volume fell \\n9% to $58 billion, and profits fell 50%. \\n \\n The slowdown in residential real estate activity stems in part from the weakened lending practices \\nof recent years.  The \\xe2\\x80\\x9coptional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d contracts and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cteaser\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rates that have been popular have allowed borrowers \\nto make payments in the early years of their mortgages that fall far short of covering normal interest costs.  \\nNaturally, there are few defaults when virtually nothing is required of a borrower.  As a cynic has said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA \\nrolling loan gathers no loss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  But payments not made add to principal, and borrowers who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford \\nnormal monthly payments early on are hit later with above-normal monthly obligations.  This is the Scarlett \\nO\\xe2\\x80\\x99Hara scenario: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll think about that tomorrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  For many home owners, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has now arrived.  \\nConsequently there is a huge overhang of offerings in several of HomeServices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 markets. \\n \\n Nevertheless, we will be seeking to purchase additional brokerage operations.

Already we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received distributions of $179 million from these bonds, \\nand our remaining stake is worth $173 million.  That means our overall gain is $270 million, part of which \\ncame from the appreciation of the Euro that took place after our bond purchase. \\n \\n When we first began making foreign exchange purchases, interest-rate differentials between the \\nU.S. and most foreign countries favored a direct currency position.  But that spread turned negative in \\n2005.  We therefore looked for other ways to gain foreign-currency exposure, such as the ownership of \\nforeign equities or of U.S. stocks with major earnings abroad.  The currency factor, we should emphasize, \\nis not dominant in our selection of equities, but is merely one of many considerations. \\n \\n As our U.S. trade problems worsen, the probability that the dollar will weaken over time continues \\nto be high.  I fervently believe in real trade \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the more the better for both us and the world.  We had about \\n$1.44 trillion of this honest-to-God trade in 2006.  But the U.S. also had $.76 trillion of pseudo-trade last \\nyear \\xe2\\x80\\x93 imports for which we exchanged no goods or services.  (Ponder, for a moment, how commentators \\nwould describe the situation if our imports were $.76 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a full 6% of GDP \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we had no exports.)  \\nMaking these purchases that weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reciprocated by sales, the U.S. necessarily transferred ownership of its \\nassets or IOUs to the rest of the world.  Like a very wealthy but self-indulgent family, we peeled off a bit of \\nwhat we owned in order to consume more than we produced. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>The U.S. can do a lot of this because we are an extraordinarily rich country that has behaved \\nresponsibly in the past.  The world is therefore willing to accept our bonds, real estate, stocks and \\nbusinesses.  And we have a vast store of these to hand over. \\n \\n These transfers will have consequences, however.  Already the prediction I made last year about \\none fall-out from our spending binge has come true: The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestment income\\xe2\\x80\\x9d account of our country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\npositive in every previous year since 1915 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 turned negative in 2006.  Foreigners now earn more on their \\nU.S. investments than we do on our investments abroad.  In effect, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used up our bank account and \\nturned to our credit card.  And, like everyone who gets in hock, the U.S. will now experience \\xe2\\x80\\x9creverse \\ncompounding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as we pay ever-increasing amounts of interest on interest. \\n \\n I want to emphasize that even though our course is unwise, Americans will live better ten or \\ntwenty years from now than they do today.  Per-capita wealth will increase.  But our citizens will also be \\nforced every year to ship a significant portion of their current production abroad merely to service the cost \\nof our huge debtor position.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a history \\nhere: At one time, Charlie was my potential replacement for investing, and more recently Lou Simpson has \\nfilled that slot.  Lou is a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record of managing GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nequity portfolio.  But he is only six years younger than I.  If I were to die soon, he would fill in \\nmagnificently for a short period.  For the long-term, though, we need a different answer. \\n \\n At our October board meeting, we discussed that subject fully.  And we emerged with a plan, \\nwhich I will carry out with the help of Charlie and Lou. \\n \\n Under this plan, I intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very \\nlarge portfolio, who we hope will succeed me as Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief investment officer when the need for \\nsomeone to do that arises.  As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates. \\n \\n Picking the right person(s) will not be an easy task.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not hard, of course, to find smart people, \\namong them individuals who have impressive investment records.  But there is far more to successful long-\\nterm investing than brains and performance that has recently been good.   \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things.  A single, big mistake could wipe \\nout a long string of successes.  We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid \\nserious risks, including those never before encountered.  Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies \\ncannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Temperament is also important.  Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen \\nunderstanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term investment success.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen \\na lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. \\n \\n Finally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire.  Being able \\nto list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager.  We \\nwill need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choice, even though he or she could leave and make much \\nmore money elsewhere. \\n</p>\\n<p> 17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>There are surely people who fit what we need, but they may be hard to identify.  In 1979, Jack \\nByrne and I felt we had found such a person in Lou Simpson.  We then made an arrangement with him \\nwhereby he would be paid well for sustained overperformance.  Under this deal, he has earned large \\namounts.  Lou, however, could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous \\nterms.  If money alone had been the object, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what he would have done.  But Lou never \\nconsidered such a move.  We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff.   \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n The good news: At 76, I feel terrific and, according to all measurable indicators, am in excellent \\nhealth.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing what Cherry Coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow. \\n \\nSome Changes on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Board \\n \\n The composition of our board will change in two ways this spring.  One change will involve the \\nChace family, which has been connected to Berkshire and its predecessor companies for more than a \\ncentury.  In 1929, the first Malcolm G. Chace played an important role in merging four New England \\ntextile operations into Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.  That company merged with Hathaway \\nManufacturing in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway, and Malcolm G. Chace, Jr. became its chairman. \\n \\n Early in 1965, Malcolm arranged for Buffett Partnership Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire \\nshares and welcomed us as the new controlling shareholder of the company.  Malcolm continued as non-\\nexecutive chairman until 1969.  He was both a wonderful gentleman and helpful partner. \\n \\n That description also fits his son, Malcolm \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKim\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chace, who succeeded his father on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nboard in 1992.  But last year Kim, now actively and successfully running a community bank that he \\nfounded in 1996, suggested that we find a younger person to replace him on our board.  We have done so, \\nand Kim will step down as a director at the annual meeting.  I owe much to the Chaces and wish to thank \\nKim for his many years of service to Berkshire. \\n \\n In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board \\nmembers be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent.  I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctruly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because many \\ndirectors who are now deemed independent by various authorities and observers are far from that, relying \\nheavily as they do on directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fees to maintain their standard of living.  These payments, which come in \\nmany forms, often range between $150,000 and $250,000 annually, compensation that may approach or \\neven exceed all other income of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d director.  And \\xe2\\x80\\x93 surprise, surprise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 director \\ncompensation has soared in recent years, pushed up by recommendations from corporate America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nfavorite consultant, Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo.  (The name may be phony, but the action it conveys is \\nnot.) \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe our four criteria are essential if directors are to do their job \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which, by law, \\nis to faithfully represent owners.  Yet these criteria are usually ignored.  Instead, consultants and CEOs \\nseeking board candidates will often say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca Hispanic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomeone from \\nabroad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or what have you.  It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ark.  Over the years \\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes he think like \\nan intelligent owner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   \\n \\n The questions I instead get would sound ridiculous to someone seeking candidates for, say, a \\nfootball team, or an arbitration panel or a military command.  In those cases, the selectors would look for \\npeople who had the specific talents and attitudes that were required for a specialized job.  At Berkshire, we \\nare in the specialized activity of running a business well, and therefore we seek business judgment. \\n \\n That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found in Susan Decker, CFO of Yahoo!, who will join our board at the \\nannual meeting.  We are lucky to have her: She scores very high on our four criteria and additionally, at 44, \\nis young \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an attribute, as you may have noticed, that your Chairman has long lacked.  We will seek more \\nyoung directors in the future, but never by slighting the four qualities that we insist upon. \\n</p>\\n<p> 18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>This and That \\n \\n Berkshire will pay about $4.4 billion in federal income tax on its 2006 earnings.  In its last fiscal \\nyear the U.S. Government spent $2.6 trillion, or about $7 billion per day.  Thus, for more than half of one \\nday, Berkshire picked up the tab for all federal expenditures, ranging from Social Security and Medicare \\npayments to the cost of our armed services.  Had there been only 600 taxpayers like Berkshire, no one else \\nin America would have needed to pay any federal income or payroll taxes. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Our federal return last year, we should add, ran to 9,386 pages.  To handle this filing, state and \\nforeign tax returns, a myriad of SEC requirements, and all of the other matters involved in running \\nBerkshire, we have gone all the way up to 19 employees at World Headquarters. \\n \\n This crew occupies 9,708 square feet of space, and Charlie \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at World Headquarters West in Los \\nAngeles \\xe2\\x80\\x93 uses another 655 square feet.  Our home-office payroll, including benefits and counting both \\nlocations, totaled $3,531,978 last year.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re careful when spending your money. \\n \\n Corporate bigwigs often complain about government spending, criticizing bureaucrats who they \\nsay spend taxpayers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 money differently from how they would if it were their own.  But sometimes the \\nfinancial behavior of executives will also vary based on whose wallet is getting depleted.  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an \\nillustrative tale from my days at Salomon.  In the 1980s the company had a barber, Jimmy by name, who \\ncame in weekly to give free haircuts to the top brass.  A manicurist was also on tap.  Then, because of a \\ncost-cutting drive, patrons were told to pay their own way.  One top executive (not the CEO) who had \\npreviously visited Jimmy weekly went immediately to a once-every-three-weeks schedule. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\nEvery now and then Charlie and I catch on early to a tide-like trend, one brimming over with \\n</p>\\n<p>commercial promise.  For example, though American Airlines (with its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmiles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and American Express \\n(with credit card points) are credited as being trailblazers in granting customers \\xe2\\x80\\x9crewards,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Charlie and I \\nwere far ahead of them in spotting the appeal of this powerful idea.  Excited by our insight, the two of us \\njumped into the reward business way back in 1970 by buying control of a trading stamp operation, Blue \\nChip Stamps.  In that year, Blue Chip had sales of $126 million, and its stamps papered California. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>In 1970, indeed, about 60 billion of our stamps were licked by savers, pasted into books, and taken \\nto Blue Chip redemption stores.  Our catalog of rewards was 116 pages thick and chock full of tantalizing \\nitems.  When I was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons, I felt I had \\nfinally found a sure thing. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Well, not quite.  From the day Charlie and I stepped into the Blue Chip picture, the business went \\nstraight downhill.  By 1980, sales had fallen to $19.4 million.  And, by 1990, sales were bumping along at \\n$1.5 million.  No quitter, I redoubled my managerial efforts. \\n \\n Sales then fell another 98%.  Last year, in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $98 billion of revenues, all of $25,920 (no \\nzeros omitted) came from Blue Chip.  Ever hopeful, Charlie and I soldier on. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n I mentioned last year that in my service on 19 corporate boards (not counting Berkshire or other \\ncontrolled companies), I have been the Typhoid Mary of compensation committees.  At only one company \\nwas I assigned to comp committee duty, and then I was promptly outvoted on the most crucial decision that \\nwe faced.  My ostracism has been peculiar, considering that I certainly haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lacked experience in setting \\nCEO pay.  At Berkshire, after all, I am a one-man compensation committee who determines the salaries \\nand incentives for the CEOs of around 40 significant operating businesses. \\n</p>\\n<p> 19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> How much time does this aspect of my job take?  Virtually none.  How many CEOs have \\nvoluntarily left us for other jobs in our 42-year history?  Precisely none. \\n \\n Berkshire employs many different incentive arrangements, with their terms depending on such \\nelements as the economic potential or capital intensity of a CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business.  Whatever the compensation \\narrangement, though, I try to keep it both simple and fair. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>When we use incentives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and these can be large \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they are always tied to the operating results for \\nwhich a given CEO has authority.  We issue no lottery tickets that carry payoffs unrelated to business \\nperformance.  If a CEO bats .300, he gets paid for being a .300 hitter, even if circumstances outside of his \\ncontrol cause Berkshire to perform poorly.  And if he bats .150, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a payoff just because the \\nsuccesses of others have enabled Berkshire to prosper mightily.  An example:  We now own $61 billion of \\nequities at Berkshire, whose value can easily rise or fall by 10% in a given year.  Why in the world should \\nthe pay of our operating executives be affected by such $6 billion swings, however important the gain or \\nloss may be for shareholders? \\n \\n You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read loads about CEOs who have received astronomical compensation for mediocre \\nresults.  Much less well-advertised is the fact that America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEOs also generally live the good life.  Many, \\nit should be emphasized, are exceptionally able, and almost all work far more than 40 hours a week.  But \\nthey are usually treated like royalty in the process.  (And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re certainly going to keep it that way at \\nBerkshire.  Though Charlie still favors sackcloth and ashes, I prefer to be spoiled rotten.  Berkshire owns \\nThe Pampered Chef; our wonderful office group has made me The Pampered Chief.) \\n \\n CEO perks at one company are quickly copied elsewhere.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll the other kids have one\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may seem \\na thought too juvenile to use as a rationale in the boardroom.  But consultants employ precisely this \\nargument, phrased more elegantly of course, when they make recommendations to comp committees. \\n \\n Irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cindependent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comp committee members.  Indeed, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely that the reason I was rejected for \\nservice on so many comp committees was that I was regarded as too independent.  Compensation reform \\nwill only occur if the largest institutional shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it would only take a few \\xe2\\x80\\x93 demand a fresh look at \\nthe whole system.  The consultants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 present drill of deftly selecting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d companies to compare with their \\nclients will only perpetuate present excesses. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Last year I arranged for the bulk of my Berkshire holdings to go to five charitable foundations, \\nthus carrying out part of my lifelong plan to eventually use all of my shares for philanthropic purposes.  \\nDetails of the commitments I made, as well as the rationale for them, are posted on our website, \\nwww.berkshirehathaway.com.  Taxes, I should note, had nothing to do with my decision or its timing.  My \\nfederal and state income taxes in 2006 were exactly what they would have been had I not made my first \\ncontributions last summer, and the same point will apply to my 2007 contributions. \\n \\n In my will I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stipulated that the proceeds from all Berkshire shares I still own at death are to be \\nused for philanthropic purposes within ten years after my estate is closed.  Because my affairs are not \\ncomplicated, it should take three years at most for this closing to occur.  Adding this 13-year period to my \\nexpected lifespan of about 12 years (though, naturally, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m aiming for more) means that proceeds from all \\nof my Berkshire shares will likely be distributed for societal purposes over the next 25 years or so. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve set this schedule because I want the money to be spent relatively promptly by people I know \\nto be capable, vigorous and motivated.  These managerial attributes sometimes wane as institutions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nparticularly those that are exempt from market forces \\xe2\\x80\\x93 age.  Today, there are terrific people in charge at \\nthe five foundations.  So at my death, why should they not move with dispatch to judiciously spend the \\nmoney that remains? \\n</p>\\n<p> 20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<div class=\"annotation\"><a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/\">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/</a></div>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Those people favoring perpetual foundations argue that in the future there will most certainly be \\nlarge and important societal problems that philanthropy will need to address.  I agree.  But there will then \\nalso be many super-rich individuals and families whose wealth will exceed that of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Americans and \\nto whom philanthropic organizations can make their case for funding.  These funders can then judge \\nfirsthand which operations have both the vitality and the focus to best address the major societal problems \\nthat then exist.  In this way, a market test of ideas and effectiveness can be applied.  Some organizations \\nwill deserve major support while others will have outlived their usefulness.  Even if the people above \\nground make their decisions imperfectly, they should be able to allocate funds more rationally than a \\ndecedent six feet under will have ordained decades earlier.  Wills, of course, can always be rewritten, but \\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very unlikely that my thinking will change in a material way. \\n \\n A few shareholders have expressed concern that sales of Berkshire by the foundations receiving \\nshares will depress the stock.  These fears are unwarranted.  The annual trading volume of many stocks \\nexceeds 100% of the outstanding shares, but nevertheless these stocks usually sell at prices approximating \\ntheir intrinsic value.  Berkshire also tends to sell at an appropriate price, but with annual volume that is only \\n15% of shares outstanding.  At most, sales by the foundations receiving my shares will add three \\npercentage points to annual trading volume, which will still leave Berkshire with a turnover ratio that is the \\nlowest around. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business performance will determine the price of our stock, and most of the \\ntime it will sell in a zone of reasonableness.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that the foundations receive appropriate prices \\nas they periodically sell Berkshire shares, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also important that incoming shareholders don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overpay.  \\n(See economic principle 14 on page 77.)  By both our policies and shareholder communications, Charlie \\nand I will do our best to ensure that Berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor large premium to intrinsic \\nvalue. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n The existence of foundation ownership will in no way influence our board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decisions about \\ndividends, repurchases, or the issuance of shares.  We will follow exactly the same rule that has guided us \\nin the past: What action will be likely to deliver the best result for shareholders over time? \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * \\n In last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report I allegorically described the Gotrocks family \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a clan that owned all of \\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s businesses and that counterproductively attempted to increase its investment returns by paying \\never-greater commissions and fees to \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelpers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Sad to say, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued its self-destructive \\nways in 2006. \\n \\n In part the family persists in this folly because it harbors unrealistic expectations about obtainable \\nreturns.  Sometimes these delusions are self-serving.  For example, private pension plans can temporarily \\noverstate their earnings, and public pension plans can defer the need for increased taxes, by using \\ninvestment assumptions that are likely to be out of reach.  Actuaries and auditors go along with these \\ntactics, and it can be decades before the chickens come home to roost (at which point the CEO or public \\nofficial who misled the world is apt to be gone). \\n \\n Meanwhile, Wall Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pied Pipers of Performance will have encouraged the futile hopes of the \\nfamily. The hapless Gotrocks will be assured that they all can achieve above-average investment \\nperformance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but only by paying ever-higher fees.  Call this promise the adult version of Lake Woebegon. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>In 2006, promises and fees hit new highs.  A flood of money went from institutional investors to \\nthe 2-and-20 crowd.  For those innocent of this arrangement, let me explain: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lopsided system whereby \\n2% of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or, for that matter, \\nloses you a bundle \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, additionally, 20% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds, even if his success \\nis due simply to a rising tide.  For example, a manager who achieves a gross return of 10% in a year will \\nkeep 3.6 percentage points \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two points off the top plus 20% of the residual 8 points \\xe2\\x80\\x93 leaving only 6.4 \\npercentage points for his investors.  On a $3 billion fund, this 6.4% net \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperformance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will deliver the \\nmanager a cool $108 million.  He will receive this bonanza even though an index fund might have returned \\n15% to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. \\n</p>\\n<p> 21</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably \\nsuccessful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unless his investors made money.  My \\nadmiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight.  A full fifty years ago, Walter was my \\nsole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. \\n \\n Walter did not go to business school, or for that matter, college.  His office contained one file \\ncabinet in 1956; the number mushroomed to four by 2002.  Walter worked without a secretary, clerk or \\nbookkeeper, his only associate being his son, Edwin, a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts.  \\nWalter and Edwin never came within a mile of inside information.  Indeed, they used \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutside\\xe2\\x80\\x9d information \\nonly sparingly, generally selecting securities by certain simple statistical methods Walter learned while \\nworking for Ben Graham.  When Walter and Edwin were asked in 1989 by Outstanding Investors Digest, \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow would you summarize your approach?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Edwin replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe try to buy stocks cheap.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  So much for \\nModern Portfolio Theory, technical analysis, macroeconomic thoughts and complex algorithms. \\n \\n Following a strategy that involved no real risk \\xe2\\x80\\x93 defined as permanent loss of capital \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Walter \\nproduced results over his 47 partnership years that dramatically surpassed those of the S&amp;P 500.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nparticularly noteworthy that he built this record by investing in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a \\nlackluster type.  A few big winners did not account for his success.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe to say that had millions of \\ninvestment managers made trades by a) drawing stock names from a hat; b) purchasing these stocks in \\ncomparable amounts when Walter made a purchase; and then c) selling when Walter sold his pick, the \\nluckiest of them would not have come close to equaling his record.  There is simply no possibility that what \\nWalter achieved over 47 years was due to chance. \\n \\n I first publicly discussed Walter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarkable record in 1984.  At that time \\xe2\\x80\\x9cefficient market \\ntheory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (EMT) was the centerpiece of investment instruction at most major business schools.  This theory, \\nas then most commonly taught, held that the price of any stock at any moment is not demonstrably \\nmispriced, which means that no investor can be expected to overperform the stock market averages using \\nonly publicly-available information (though some will do so by luck).  When I talked about Walter 23 years \\nago, his record forcefully contradicted this dogma. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>And what did members of the academic community do when they were exposed to this new and \\nimportant evidence?  Unfortunately, they reacted in all-too-human fashion: Rather than opening their \\nminds, they closed their eyes.  To my knowledge no business school teaching EMT made any attempt to \\nstudy Walter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance and what it meant for the school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cherished theory.    \\n \\n Instead, the faculties of the schools went merrily on their way presenting EMT as having the \\ncertainty of scripture.  Typically, a finance instructor who had the nerve to question EMT had about as \\nmuch chance of major promotion as Galileo had of being named Pope. \\n \\n Tens of thousands of students were therefore sent out into life believing that on every day the price \\nof every stock was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (or, more accurately, not demonstrably wrong) and that attempts to evaluate \\nbusinesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is, stocks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were useless.  Walter meanwhile went on overperforming, his job made easier \\nby the misguided instructions that had been given to those young minds.  After all, if you are in the \\nshipping business, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helpful to have all of your potential competitors be taught that the earth is flat. \\n \\n Maybe it was a good thing for his investors that Walter didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to college. \\n</p>\\n<p> 22</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \\nyou money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.  And while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \\ncredit card.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one I now use (sparingly, of course). \\n \\n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available \\nfor your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to \\nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel that you wish on board with you. \\n \\n In the Bookworm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corner of our bazaar, there will be about 25 books and DVDs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all discounted \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 led again by Poor Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Almanack.

Among them are Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger by Peter \\nBevelin, a long-time Swedish shareholder of Berkshire, and Fred Schwed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s classic, Where are the \\nCustomers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Yachts?  This book was first published in 1940 and is now in its 4th edition.  The funniest book \\never written about investing, it lightly delivers many truly important messages on the subject. \\n \\n An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \\nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel \\nrooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. \\n \\n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \\nwe will again be having \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM ten \\nyears ago, and sales during the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30 million in 2006.  I get \\ngoose bumps just thinking about this volume. \\n \\n To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 3rd and \\nMonday, May 7th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will \\neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \\ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We \\nappreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.  \\n</p>\\n<p> 23</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The \\nfirst will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 4th.

Ariel, though only 11, is \\nranked number one among girls under 16 in the U.S. (and number 1 among both boys and girls under 12).  \\nThe week I turned 75 I played Ariel, then 9 and barely tall enough to see across the table, thinking I would \\ntake it easy on her so as not to crush her young spirit.  Instead she crushed me.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve since devised a plan \\nthat will give me a chance against her.  At 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will initiate play with a 2-point game against \\nAriel.  If I somehow win the first point, I will then feign injury and claim victory.  After this strenuous \\nencounter wears Ariel down, our shareholders can then try their luck against her. \\n \\n Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6th, and will be \\nserving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on that day, you must have a \\nreservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before).   \\n \\n In the 2006-2007 school year, 35 university classes, including one from IBMEC in Brazil, will \\ncome to Omaha for sessions with me.  I take almost all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in aggregate, more than 2,000 students \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to lunch \\nat Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  And they love it.

Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and \\nCharlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed \\nmeeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other \\nthan the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Charlie and I are extraordinarily lucky.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> \\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n \\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2007 was $12.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 11%.  Over the last 43 years (that is, since present management took \\nover) book value has grown from $19 to $78,008, a rate of 21.1% compounded annually.* \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, our 76 operating businesses did well last year.  The few that had problems were primarily \\nthose linked to housing, among them our brick, carpet and real estate brokerage operations.  Their setbacks \\nare minor and temporary.  Our competitive position in these businesses remains strong, and we have first-\\nclass CEOs who run them right, in good times or bad. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nSome major financial institutions have, however, experienced staggering problems because they \\n</p>\\n<p>engaged in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweakened lending practices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I described in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter.  John Stumpf, CEO of Wells \\nFargo, aptly dissected the recent behavior of many lenders: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is interesting that the industry has invented \\nnew ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nYou may recall a 2003 Silicon Valley bumper sticker that implored, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, God, Just One More \\n</p>\\n<p>Bubble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Unfortunately, this wish was promptly granted, as just about all Americans came to believe that \\nhouse prices would forever rise.  That conviction made a borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s income and cash equity seem \\nunimportant to lenders, who shoveled out money, confident that HPA \\xe2\\x80\\x93 house price appreciation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would \\ncure all problems.  Today, our country is experiencing widespread pain because of that erroneous belief.  \\nAs house prices fall, a huge amount of financial folly is being exposed.  You only learn who has been \\nswimming naked when the tide goes out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and what we are witnessing at some of our largest financial \\ninstitutions is an ugly sight. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Turning to happier thoughts, we can report that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newest acquisitions of size, TTI and \\nIscar, led by their CEOs, Paul Andrews and Jacob Harpaz respectively, performed magnificently in 2007.  \\nIscar is as impressive a manufacturing operation as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen, a view I reported last year and that was \\nconfirmed by a visit I made in the fall to its extraordinary plant in Korea. \\n \\n Finally, our insurance business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the cornerstone of Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had an excellent year.  Part of the \\nreason is that we have the best collection of insurance managers in the business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more about them later.  \\nBut we also were very lucky in 2007, the second year in a row free of major insured catastrophes. \\n \\n That party is over.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a certainty that insurance-industry profit margins, including ours, will fall \\nsignificantly in 2008.  Prices are down, and exposures inexorably rise.  Even if the U.S. has its third \\nconsecutive catastrophe-light year, industry profit margins will probably shrink by four percentage points \\nor so.  If the winds roar or the earth trembles, results could be far worse.  So be prepared for lower \\ninsurance earnings during the next few years. \\n \\nYardsticks \\n \\n Berkshire has two major areas of value.  The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash \\nequivalents.  At yearend these totaled $141 billion (not counting those in our finance or utility operations, \\nwhich we assign to our second bucket of value). \\n \\n  \\n *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.  Figures for the B shares \\nare 1/30th of those shown for the A. \\n</p>\\n<p> 3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Insurance float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to \\nus \\xe2\\x80\\x93 funds $59 billion of our investments.  This float is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as long as insurance underwriting breaks \\neven, meaning that the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur.  Of course, insurance \\nunderwriting is volatile, swinging erratically between profits and losses.  Over our entire history, however, \\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been profitable, and I expect we will average breakeven results or better in the future.  If we do that, \\nour investments can be viewed as an unencumbered source of value for Berkshire shareholders. \\n \\n Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments \\nand insurance.  These earnings are delivered by our 66 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 76.  In \\nour early years, we focused on the investment side.  During the past two decades, however, we have put \\never more emphasis on the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses. \\n \\n The following tables illustrate this shift.  In the first we tabulate per-share investments at 14-year \\nintervals.  We exclude those applicable to minority interests. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nYear\\n</p>\\n<p>Per-Share \\nInvestments\\n</p>\\n<p> \\nYears\\n</p>\\n<p>Compounded Annual \\nGain in Per-Share Investments\\n</p>\\n<p>    \\n1965 $         4   \\n1979 577 1965-1979 42.8% \\n1993 13,961 1979-1993 25.6% \\n2007 90,343 1993-2007 14.3% \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n For the entire 42 years, our compounded annual gain in per-share investments was 27.1%.  But the \\ntrend has been downward as we increasingly used our available funds to buy operating businesses. \\n \\n Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the record on how earnings of our non-insurance businesses have grown, again on a per-\\nshare basis and after applicable minority interests. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nYear\\n</p>\\n<p>Per Share \\nPre-Tax Earnings\\n</p>\\n<p> \\nYears\\n</p>\\n<p>Compounded Annual Gain in Per-\\nShare Pre-Tax Earnings\\n</p>\\n<p>    \\n1965 $      4   \\n1979 18 1965-1979 11.1% \\n1993 212 1979-1993 19.1% \\n2007 4,093 1993-2007 23.5% \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n For the entire period, the compounded annual gain was 17.8%, with gains accelerating as our \\nfocus shifted. \\n \\n Though these tables may help you gain historical perspective and be useful in valuation, they are \\ncompletely misleading in predicting future possibilities.  Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past record can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be duplicated or \\neven approached.  Our base of assets and earnings is now far too large for us to make outsized gains in the \\nfuture. \\n \\n Charlie Munger, my partner at Berkshire, and I will continue to measure our progress by the two \\nyardsticks I have just described and will regularly update you on the results.  Though we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come close \\nto duplicating the past, we will do our best to make sure the future is not disappointing. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n In our efforts, we will be aided enormously by the managers who have joined Berkshire.  This is \\nan unusual group in several ways.  First, most of them have no financial need to work.  Many sold us their \\nbusinesses for large sums and run them because they love doing so, not because they need the money.  \\nNaturally they wish to be paid fairly, but money alone is not the reason they work hard and productively. \\n</p>\\n<p> 4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> A second, somewhat related, point about these managers is that they have exactly the job they \\nwant for the rest of their working years.  At almost any other company, key managers below the top aspire \\nto keep climbing the pyramid.  For them, the subsidiary or division they manage today is a way station \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or \\nso they hope.  Indeed, if they are in their present positions five years from now, they may well feel like \\nfailures. \\n \\n Conversely, our CEOs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 scorecards for success are not whether they obtain my job but instead are \\nthe long-term performances of their businesses.  Their decisions flow from a here-today, here-forever \\nmindset.  I think our rare and hard-to-replicate managerial structure gives Berkshire a real advantage. \\n \\nAcquisitions \\n \\n Though our managers may be the best, we will need large and sensible acquisitions to get the \\ngrowth in operating earnings we wish.  Here, we made little progress in 2007 until very late in the year.  \\nThen, on Christmas day, Charlie and I finally earned our paychecks by contracting for the largest cash \\npurchase in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history. \\n \\n The seeds of this transaction were planted in 1954.  That fall, only three months into a new job, I \\nwas sent by my employers, Ben Graham and Jerry Newman, to a shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meeting of Rockwood \\nChocolate in Brooklyn.  A young fellow had recently taken control of this company, a manufacturer of \\nassorted cocoa-based items.  He had then initiated a one-of-a-kind tender, offering 80 pounds of cocoa \\nbeans for each share of Rockwood stock.  I described this transaction in a section of the 1988 annual report \\nthat explained arbitrage.  I also told you that Jay Pritzker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the young fellow mentioned above \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was the \\nbusiness genius behind this tax-efficient idea, the possibilities for which had escaped all the other experts \\nwho had thought about buying Rockwood, including my bosses, Ben and Jerry. \\n \\n At the meeting, Jay was friendly and gave me an education on the 1954 tax code.  I came away \\nvery impressed.  Thereafter, I avidly followed Jay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business dealings, which were many and brilliant.  His \\nvalued partner was his brother, Bob, who for nearly 50 years ran Marmon Group, the home for most of the \\nPritzker businesses. \\n \\n Jay died in 1999, and Bob retired early in 2002.  Around then, the Pritzker family decided to \\ngradually sell or reorganize certain of its holdings, including Marmon, a company operating 125 \\nbusinesses, managed through nine sectors.  Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest operation is Union Tank Car, which together \\nwith a Canadian counterpart owns 94,000 rail cars that are leased to various shippers.  The original cost of \\nthis fleet is $5.1 billion.  All told, Marmon has $7 billion in sales and about 20,000 employees. \\n \\n We will soon purchase 60% of Marmon and will acquire virtually all of the balance within six \\nyears.  Our initial outlay will be $4.5 billion, and the price of our later purchases will be based on a formula \\ntied to earnings.  Prior to our entry into the picture, the Pritzker family received substantial consideration \\nfrom Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distribution of cash, investments and certain businesses. \\n \\n This deal was done in the way Jay would have liked.  We arrived at a price using only Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nfinancial statements, employing no advisors and engaging in no nit-picking.  I knew that the business \\nwould be exactly as the Pritzkers represented, and they knew that we would close on the dot, however \\nchaotic financial markets might be.  During the past year, many large deals have been renegotiated or killed \\nentirely.  With the Pritzkers, as with Berkshire, a deal is a deal.  \\n \\n Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, Frank Ptak, works closely with a long-time associate, John Nichols.  John was \\nformerly the highly successful CEO of Illinois Tool Works (ITW), where he teamed with Frank to run a \\nmix of industrial businesses.  Take a look at their ITW record; you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be impressed. \\n</p>\\n<p> 5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Charlie and I trust \\nhim completely. \\n \\n You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll like the code name that Goldman Sachs assigned the deal.  Marmon entered the auto \\nbusiness in 1902 and exited it in 1933.  Along the way it manufactured the Wasp, a car that won the first \\nIndianapolis 500 race, held in 1911.  So this deal was labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndy 500.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n In May 2006, I spoke at a lunch at Ben Bridge, our Seattle-based jewelry chain.

We soon made a deal for his business, simultaneously purchasing a supplier of about \\nequal size.  The new company, Richline Group, has since made two smaller acquisitions.  Even with those, \\nRichline is far below the earnings threshold we normally require for purchases.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m willing to bet, \\nhowever, that Dennis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the help of his partner, Dave Meleski \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will build a large operation, earning \\ngood returns on capital employed. \\n \\nBusinesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The Great, the Good and the Gruesome \\n \\n Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at what kind of businesses turn us on.  And while we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at it, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also discuss \\nwhat we wish to avoid. \\n \\n Charlie and I look for companies that have a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term \\neconomics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag.  We like to buy the whole \\nbusiness or, if management is our partner, at least 80%.  When control-type purchases of quality aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\navailable, though, we are also happy to simply buy small portions of great businesses by way of stock-\\nmarket purchases.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better to have a part interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone. \\n \\n A truly great business must have an enduring \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that protects excellent returns on invested \\ncapital.  The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccastle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is earning high returns.  Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being the low-\\ncost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerful world-wide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American \\nExpress) is essential for sustained success.  Business history is filled with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoman Candles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d companies \\nwhose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed. \\n \\n Our criterion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenduring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and \\ncontinuous change.  Though capitalism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccreative destruction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is highly beneficial for society, it precludes \\ninvestment certainty.  A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all. \\n \\n Additionally, this criterion eliminates the business whose success depends on having a great \\nmanager.  Of course, a terrific CEO is a huge asset for any enterprise, and at Berkshire we have an \\nabundance of these managers.  Their abilities have created billions of dollars of value that would never \\nhave materialized if typical CEOs had been running their businesses.  \\n \\n But if a business requires a superstar to produce great results, the business itself cannot be deemed \\ngreat.  A medical partnership led by your area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier brain surgeon may enjoy outsized and growing \\nearnings, but that tells little about its future.  The partnership\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moat will go when the surgeon goes.  You \\ncan count, though, on the moat of the Mayo Clinic to endure, even though you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t name its CEO. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry is what we seek in a business.  If that comes \\nwith rapid organic growth, great.  But even without organic growth, such a business is rewarding.  We will  \\nsimply take the lush earnings of the business and use them to buy similar businesses elsewhere.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no  \\nrule that you have to invest money where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve earned it.  Indeed, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often a mistake to do so: Truly \\ngreat businesses, earning huge returns on tangible assets, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for any extended period reinvest a large \\nportion of their earnings internally at high rates of return. \\n \\n Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at the prototype of a dream business, our own See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candy.  The boxed-chocolates \\nindustry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\ngrow.  Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than \\ntoken profits over the last forty years.  Indeed, I believe that See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, though it obtains the bulk of its revenues \\nfrom only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings. \\n \\n At See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, annual sales were 16 million pounds of candy when Blue Chip Stamps purchased the \\ncompany in 1972.  (Charlie and I controlled Blue Chip at the time and later merged it into Berkshire.)  Last \\nyear See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sold 31 million pounds, a growth rate of only 2% annually.  Yet its durable competitive \\nadvantage, built by the See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family over a 50-year period, and strengthened subsequently by Chuck \\nHuggins and Brad Kinstler, has produced extraordinary results for Berkshire. \\n \\n We bought See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less \\nthan $5 million.  The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million.  (Modest seasonal debt \\nwas also needed for a few months each year.)  Consequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on \\ninvested capital.  Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations.  First, the product was \\nsold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable.  Second, the production and distribution cycle was \\nshort, which minimized inventories. \\n \\n Last year See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales were $383 million, and pre-tax profits were $82 million.  The capital now \\nrequired to run the business is $40 million.  This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since \\n1972 to handle the modest physical growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and somewhat immodest financial growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of the business.  \\nIn the meantime pre-tax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion.  All of that, except for the $32 million, has \\nbeen sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip).  After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we \\nhave used the rest to buy other attractive businesses.  Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led \\nto six billion humans, See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us.  (The biblical command \\nto \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe fruitful and multiply\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is one we take seriously at Berkshire.) \\n \\n There aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t many See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in Corporate America.  Typically, companies that increase their earnings \\nfrom $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their \\ngrowth.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because growing businesses have both working capital needs that increase in proportion to \\nsales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments. \\n \\n A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a \\nsatisfactory investment.  There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 \\nmillion pre-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets.  But that equation for the owner is vastly different \\nfrom the See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no \\nmajor capital requirements.  Ask Microsoft or Google. \\n \\n One example of good, but far from sensational, business economics is our own FlightSafety.  This \\ncompany delivers benefits to its customers that are the equal of those delivered by any business that I know \\nof.  It also possesses a durable competitive advantage: Going to any other flight-training provider than the \\nbest is like taking the low bid on a surgical procedure. \\n</p>\\n<p> 7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> Nevertheless, this business requires a significant reinvestment of earnings if it is to grow.  When \\nwe purchased FlightSafety in 1996, its pre-tax operating earnings were $111 million, and its net investment \\nin fixed assets was $570 million.  Since our purchase, depreciation charges have totaled $923 million.  But \\ncapital expenditures have totaled $1.635 billion, most of that for simulators to match the new airplane \\nmodels that are constantly being introduced.  (A simulator can cost us more than $12 million, and we have \\n273 of them.)  Our fixed assets, after depreciation, now amount to $1.079 billion.  Pre-tax operating \\nearnings in 2007 were $270 million, a gain of $159 million since 1996.  That gain gave us a good, but far \\nfrom See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-like, return on our incremental investment of $509 million. \\n \\n Consequently, if measured only by economic returns, FlightSafety is an excellent but not \\nextraordinary business.  Its put-up-more-to-earn-more experience is that faced by most corporations.  For \\nexample, our large investment in regulated utilities falls squarely in this category.  We will earn \\nconsiderably more money in this business ten years from now, but we will invest many billions to make it. \\n \\n Now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move to the gruesome.  The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires \\nsignificant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money.  Think airlines.  Here a \\ndurable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers.  Indeed, if a \\nfarsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by \\nshooting Orville down. \\n \\n The airline industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable.  Investors \\nhave poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.  \\nAnd I, to my shame, participated in this foolishness when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in \\n1989.  As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred \\ndividend was no longer being paid.  But we then got very lucky.  In one of the recurrent, but always \\nmisguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actually able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain.  \\nIn the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt.  Twice. \\n \\n To sum up, think of three types of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csavings accounts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The great one pays an extraordinarily high \\ninterest rate that will rise as the years pass.  The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be \\nearned also on deposits that are added.  Finally, the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate \\nand requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n And now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confession time.  It should be noted that no consultant, board of directors or \\ninvestment banker pushed me into the mistakes I will describe.  In tennis parlance, they were all unforced \\nerrors. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n To begin with, I almost blew the See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purchase.  The seller was asking $30 million, and I was \\nadamant about not going above $25 million.  Fortunately, he caved.  Otherwise I would have balked, and \\nthat $1.35 billion would have gone to somebody else. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n About the time of the See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purchase, Tom Murphy, then running Capital Cities Broadcasting, \\ncalled and offered me the Dallas-Fort Worth NBC station for $35 million.  The station came with the Fort \\nWorth paper that Capital Cities was buying, and under the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccross-ownership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rules Murph had to divest it.  \\nI knew that TV stations were See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-like businesses that required virtually no capital investment and had \\nexcellent prospects for growth.  They were simple to run and showered cash on their owners. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n Moreover, Murph, then as now, was a close friend, a man I admired as an extraordinary manager \\nand outstanding human being.  He knew the television business forward and backward and would not have \\ncalled me unless he felt a purchase was certain to work.  In effect Murph whispered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into my ear.  But \\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t listen. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p> 8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> In 2006, the station earned $73 million pre-tax, bringing its total earnings since I turned down the \\ndeal to at least $1 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost all available to its owner for other purposes.  Moreover, the property now \\nhas a capital value of about $800 million.  Why did I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d?  The only explanation is that my brain had \\ngone on vacation and forgot to notify me.  (My behavior resembled that of a politician Molly Ivins once \\ndescribed: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf his I.Q. was any lower, you would have to water him twice a day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) \\n \\n Finally, I made an even worse mistake when I said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Dexter, a shoe business I bought in \\n1993 for $433 million in Berkshire stock (25,203 shares of A).  What I had assessed as durable competitive \\nadvantage vanished within a few years.  But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the beginning: By using Berkshire stock, I \\ncompounded this error hugely.  That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but \\nrather $3.5 billion.  In essence, I gave away 1.6% of a wonderful business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one now valued at $220 billion \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 to buy a worthless business. \\n \\n To date, Dexter is the worst deal that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made.

       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 GEICO possesses the widest moat of any of our insurers, one carefully protected and expanded by \\n</p>\\n<p>Tony Nicely, its CEO.  Last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 GEICO had the best growth record among major auto \\ninsurers, increasing its market share to 7.2%.  When Berkshire acquired control in 1995, that share \\nwas 2.5%.  Not coincidentally, annual ad expenditures by GEICO have increased from $31 million \\nto $751 million during the same period. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nTony, now 64, joined GEICO at 18.  Every day since, he has been passionate about the company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nproud of how it could both save money for its customers and provide growth opportunities for its \\nassociates.  Even now, with sales at $12 billion, Tony feels GEICO is just getting started.  So do I. \\n \\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some evidence.  In the last three years, GEICO has increased its share of the motorcycle \\nmarket from 2.1% to 6%.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also recently begun writing policies on ATVs and RVs.  And in \\nNovember we wrote our first commercial auto policy.  GEICO and National Indemnity are \\nworking together in the commercial field, and early results are very encouraging. \\n \\nEven in aggregate, these lines will remain a small fraction of our personal auto volume.  \\nNevertheless, they should deliver a growing stream of underwriting profits and float. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 General Re, our international reinsurer, is by far our largest source of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome-grown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $23 \\n</p>\\n<p>billion at yearend.  This operation is now a huge asset for Berkshire.  Our ownership, however, \\nhad a shaky start. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nFor decades, General Re was the Tiffany of reinsurers, admired by all for its underwriting skills \\nand discipline.  This reputation, unfortunately, outlived its factual underpinnings, a flaw that I \\ncompletely missed when I made the decision in 1998 to merge with General Re.  The General Re \\nof 1998 was not operated as the General Re of 1968 or 1978. \\n \\nNow, thanks to Joe Brandon, General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, and his partner, Tad Montross, the luster of the \\ncompany has been restored.  Joe and Tad have been running the business for six years and have \\nbeen doing first-class business in a first-class way, to use the words of J. P. Morgan.  They have \\nrestored discipline to underwriting, reserving and the selection of clients. \\n \\nTheir job was made more difficult by costly and time-consuming legacy problems, both in the \\nU.S. and abroad.  Despite that diversion, Joe and Tad have delivered excellent underwriting results \\nwhile skillfully repositioning the company for the future. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Since joining Berkshire in 1986, Ajit Jain has built a truly great specialty reinsurance operation \\nfrom scratch.  For one-of-a-kind mammoth transactions, the world now turns to him. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nLast year I told you in detail about the Equitas transfer of huge, but capped, liabilities to Berkshire \\nfor a single premium of $7.1 billion.  At this very early date, our experience has been good.  But \\nthis doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell us much because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just one straw in a fifty-year-or-more wind.  What we know \\nfor sure, however, is that the London team who joined us, headed by Scott Moser, is first-rate and \\nhas become a valuable asset for our insurance business. \\n \\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Finally, we have our smaller operations, which serve specialized segments of the insurance \\nmarket.  In aggregate, these companies have performed extraordinarily well, earning above-\\naverage underwriting profits and delivering valuable float for investment. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nLast year BoatU.S., headed by Bill Oakerson, was added to the group.

Overall, \\nthese companies earned $941 million pre-tax compared to $1.296 billion in 2006. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nLast year, Shaw, MiTek and Acme contracted for tuck-in acquisitions that will help future \\nearnings.

We very seldom move managers from one \\nindustry to another at Berkshire.  But we made an exception with Brad, who had previously run \\nour uniform company, Fechheimer, and Cypress Insurance.  The move could not have worked out \\nbetter.  In his two years, profits at See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have increased more than 50%. \\n</p>\\n<p> \\nAt Borsheims, sales increased 15.1%, helped by a 27% gain during Shareholder Weekend.  Two \\nyears ago, Susan Jacques suggested that we remodel and expand the store.  I was skeptical, but \\nSusan was right. \\n \\nSusan came to Borsheims 25 years ago as a $4-an-hour saleswoman.  Though she lacked a \\nmanagerial background, I did not hesitate to make her CEO in 1994.  She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smart, she loves the \\nbusiness, and she loves her associates.  That beats having an MBA degree any time. \\n \\n(An aside: Charlie and I are not big fans of resumes.  Instead, we focus on brains, passion and \\nintegrity.  Another of our great managers is Cathy Baron Tamraz, who has significantly increased \\nBusiness Wire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings since we purchased it early in 2006.  She is an owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream.  It is \\npositively dangerous to stand between Cathy and a business prospect.  Cathy, it should be noted, \\nbegan her career as a cab driver.) \\n \\nFinally, at Nebraska Furniture Mart, earnings hit a record as our Omaha and Kansas City stores \\neach had sales of about $400 million.  These, by some margin, are the two top home furnishings \\nstores in the country.  In a disastrous year for many furniture retailers, sales at Kansas City \\nincreased 8%, while in Omaha the gain was 6%.  \\n \\nCredit the remarkable Blumkin brothers, Ron and Irv, for this performance.

In effect, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve now \\nmoved the brains to the tungsten.  Major opportunities for growth await Iscar.

Bruce Whitman, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nCEO, inherited this leadership position in 2003 from Al Ueltschi, the father of advanced flight \\ntraining, and has proved to be a worthy successor. \\n</p>\\n<p> 13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

But industry volume \\ncontinues to shrink:  Last year, manufactured home sales were 96,000, down from 131,000 in 2003, the \\nyear we bought Clayton.  (At the time, it should be remembered, some commentators criticized its directors \\nfor selling at a cyclical bottom.) \\n \\n Though Clayton earns money from both manufacturing and retailing its homes, most of its \\nearnings come from an $11 billion loan portfolio, covering 300,000 borrowers.

Start-ups are not our game. \\n \\n I should emphasize that we do not measure the progress of our investments by what their market \\nprices do during any given year.  Rather, we evaluate their performance by the two methods we apply to the \\nbusinesses we own.  The first test is improvement in earnings, with our making due allowance for industry \\nconditions.

       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> We made one large sale last year.  In 2002 and 2003 Berkshire bought 1.3% of PetroChina for \\n$488 million, a price that valued the entire business at about $37 billion.  Charlie and I then felt that the \\ncompany was worth about $100 billion.  By 2007, two factors had materially increased its value: the price \\nof oil had climbed significantly, and PetroChina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management had done a great job in building oil and gas \\nreserves.  In the second half of last year, the market value of the company rose to $275 billion, about what \\nwe thought it was worth compared to other giant oil companies.  So we sold our holdings for $4 billion. \\n \\n A footnote: We paid the IRS tax of $1.2 billion on our PetroChina gain.  This sum paid all costs of \\nthe U.S. government \\xe2\\x80\\x93 defense, social security, you name it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for about four hours. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Last year I told you that Berkshire had 62 derivative contracts that I manage.  (We also have a few \\nleft in the General Re runoff book.)  Today, we have 94 of these, and they fall into two categories. \\n \\n First, we have written 54 contracts that require us to make payments if certain bonds that are \\nincluded in various high-yield indices default.  These contracts expire at various times from 2009 to 2013.  \\nAt yearend we had received $3.2 billion in premiums on these contracts; had paid $472 million in losses; \\nand in the worst case (though it is extremely unlikely to occur) could be required to pay an additional $4.7 \\nbillion. \\n \\n We are certain to make many more payments.  But I believe that on premium revenues alone, \\nthese contracts will prove profitable, leaving aside what we can earn on the large sums we hold.  Our \\nyearend liability for this exposure was recorded at $1.8 billion and is included in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDerivative Contract \\nLiabilities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on our balance sheet. \\n \\n The second category of contracts involves various put options we have sold on four stock indices \\n(the S&amp;P 500 plus three foreign indices).  These puts had original terms of either 15 or 20 years and were \\nstruck at the market.  We have received premiums of $4.5 billion, and we recorded a liability at yearend of \\n$4.6 billion.  The puts in these contracts are exercisable only at their expiration dates, which occur between \\n2019 and 2027, and Berkshire will then need to make a payment only if the index in question is quoted at a \\nlevel below that existing on the day that the put was written.  Again, I believe these contracts, in aggregate, \\nwill be profitable and that we will, in addition, receive substantial income from our investment of the \\npremiums we hold during the 15- or 20-year period. \\n \\n Two aspects of our derivative contracts are particularly important.  First, in all cases we hold the \\nmoney, which means that we have no counterparty risk. \\n \\n Second, accounting rules for our derivative contracts differ from those applying to our investment \\nportfolio.  In that portfolio, changes in value are applied to the net worth shown on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s balance \\nsheet, but do not affect earnings unless we sell (or write down) a holding.  Changes in the value of a \\nderivative contract, however, must be applied each quarter to earnings. \\n \\n Thus, our derivative positions will sometimes cause large swings in reported earnings, even \\nthough Charlie and I might believe the intrinsic value of these positions has changed little.  He and I will \\nnot be bothered by these swings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though they could easily amount to $1 billion or more in a quarter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nand we hope you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be either.  You will recall that in our catastrophe insurance business, we are always \\nready to trade increased volatility in reported earnings in the short run for greater gains in net worth in the \\nlong run.  That is our philosophy in derivatives as well. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n The U.S. dollar weakened further in 2007 against major currencies, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no mystery why: \\nAmericans like buying products made elsewhere more than the rest of the world likes buying products \\nmade in the U.S.  Inevitably, that causes America to ship about $2 billion of IOUs and assets daily to the \\nrest of the world.  And over time, that puts pressure on the dollar. \\n</p>\\n<p> 16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> When the dollar falls, it both makes our products cheaper for foreigners to buy and their products \\nmore expensive for U.S. citizens.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why a falling currency is supposed to cure a trade deficit.  Indeed, \\nthe U.S. deficit has undoubtedly been tempered by the large drop in the dollar.  But ponder this:  In 2002 \\nwhen the Euro averaged 94.6\\xc2\\xa2, our trade deficit with Germany (the fifth largest of our trading partners) was \\n$36 billion, whereas in 2007, with the Euro averaging $1.37, our deficit with Germany was up to $45 \\nbillion.  Similarly, the Canadian dollar averaged 64\\xc2\\xa2 in 2002 and 93\\xc2\\xa2 in 2007.  Yet our trade deficit with \\nCanada rose as well, from $50 billion in 2002 to $64 billion in 2007.  So far, at least, a plunging dollar has \\nnot done much to bring our trade activity into balance. \\n \\n There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been much talk recently of sovereign wealth funds and how they are buying large pieces \\nof American businesses.  This is our doing, not some nefarious plot by foreign governments.  Our trade \\nequation guarantees massive foreign investment in the U.S.  When we force-feed $2 billion daily to the rest \\nof the world, they must invest in something here.  Why should we complain when they choose stocks over \\nbonds? \\n \\n Our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weakening currency is not the fault of OPEC, China, etc.  Other developed \\ncountries rely on imported oil and compete against Chinese imports just as we do.  In developing a sensible \\ntrade policy, the U.S. should not single out countries to punish or industries to protect.  Nor should we take \\nactions likely to evoke retaliatory behavior that will reduce America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exports, true trade that benefits both \\nour country and the rest of the world. \\n \\n Our legislators should recognize, however, that the current imbalances are unsustainable and \\nshould therefore adopt policies that will materially reduce them sooner rather than later.  Otherwise our $2 \\nbillion daily of force-fed dollars to the rest of the world may produce global indigestion of an unpleasant \\nsort.  (For other comments about the unsustainability of our trade deficits, see Alan Greenspan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments \\non November 19, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minutes of June 29, 2004, and Ben \\nBernanke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement on September 11, 2007.) \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n At Berkshire we held only one direct currency position during 2007.  That was in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hold your \\nbreath \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Brazilian real.  Not long ago, swapping dollars for reals would have been unthinkable.  After \\nall, during the past century five versions of Brazilian currency have, in effect, turned into confetti.  As has \\nbeen true in many countries whose currencies have periodically withered and died, wealthy Brazilians \\nsometimes stashed large sums in the U.S. to preserve their wealth. \\n \\n But any Brazilian who followed this apparently prudent course would have lost half his net worth \\nover the past five years.  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the year-by-year record (indexed) of the real versus the dollar from the end \\nof 2002 to yearend 2007: 100; 122; 133; 152; 166; 199.  Every year the real went up and the dollar fell.  \\nMoreover, during much of this period the Brazilian government was actually holding down the value of the \\nreal and supporting our currency by buying dollars in the market. \\n \\n Our direct currency positions have yielded $2.3 billion of pre-tax profits over the past five years, \\nand in addition we have profited by holding bonds of U.S. companies that are denominated in other \\ncurrencies.  For example, in 2001 and 2002 we purchased \\xe2\\x82\\xac310 million Amazon.com, Inc. 6 7/8 of 2010 at \\n57% of par.  At the time, Amazon bonds were priced as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjunk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d credits, though they were anything but.  \\n(Yes, Virginia, you can occasionally find markets that are ridiculously inefficient \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or at least you can find \\nthem anywhere except at the finance departments of some leading business schools.)   \\n \\n The Euro denomination of the Amazon bonds was a further, and important, attraction for us.  The \\nEuro was at 95\\xc2\\xa2 when we bought in 2002.  Therefore, our cost in dollars came to only $169 million.  Now \\nthe bonds sell at 102% of par and the Euro is worth $1.47.  In 2005 and 2006 some of our bonds were \\ncalled and we received $253 million for them.  Our remaining bonds were valued at $162 million at \\nyearend.  Of our $246 million of realized and unrealized gain, about $118 million is attributable to the fall \\nin the dollar.  Currencies do matter. \\n</p>\\n<p> 17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEOs had \\njust strong-armed the U.S. Senate into ordering the Financial Accounting Standards Board to shut up, by a \\nvote that was 88-9.  Before that rebuke the FASB had shown the audacity \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by unanimous agreement, no \\nless \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to tell corporate chieftains that the stock options they were being awarded represented a form of \\ncompensation and that their value should be recorded as an expense. \\n \\n After the senators voted, the FASB \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now educated on accounting principles by the Senate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 88 \\ncloset CPAs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 decreed that companies could choose between two methods of reporting on options.  The \\npreferred treatment would be to expense their value, but it would also be allowable for companies to ignore \\nthe expense as long as their options were issued at market value. \\n \\n A moment of truth had now arrived for America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEOs, and their reaction was not a pretty sight.  \\nDuring the next six years, exactly two of the 500 companies in the S&amp;P chose the preferred route.  CEOs of \\nthe rest opted for the low road, thereby ignoring a large and obvious expense in order to report higher \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure some of them also felt that if they opted for expensing, their directors might in future \\nyears think twice before approving the mega-grants the managers longed for. \\n \\n It turned out that for many CEOs even the low road wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good enough.  Under the weakened \\nrule, there remained earnings consequences if options were issued with a strike price below market value.  \\nNo problem.  To avoid that bothersome rule, a number of companies surreptitiously backdated options to \\nfalsely indicate that they were granted at current market prices, when in fact they were dished out at prices \\nwell below market. \\n \\n Decades of option-accounting nonsense have now been put to rest, but other accounting choices \\nremain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 important among these the investment-return assumption a company uses in calculating pension \\nexpense.  It will come as no surprise that many companies continue to choose an assumption that allows \\nthem to report less-than-solid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For the 363 companies in the S&amp;P that have pension plans, this \\nassumption in 2006 averaged 8%.  Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at the chances of that being achieved. \\n</p>\\n<p> 18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> The average holdings of bonds and cash for all pension funds is about 28%, and on these assets \\nreturns can be expected to be no more than 5%. Higher yields, of course, are obtainable but they carry with \\nthem a risk of commensurate (or greater) loss. \\n \\n This means that the remaining 72% of assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which are mostly in equities, either held directly or \\nthrough vehicles such as hedge funds or private-equity investments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 must earn 9.2% in order for the fund \\noverall to achieve the postulated 8%.  And that return must be delivered after all fees, which are now far \\nhigher than they have ever been. \\n \\n How realistic is this expectation?  Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revisit some data I mentioned two years ago: During the \\n20th Century, the Dow advanced from 66 to 11,497.  This gain, though it appears huge, shrinks to 5.3% \\nwhen compounded annually.  An investor who owned the Dow throughout the century would also have \\nreceived generous dividends for much of the period, but only about 2% or so in the final years.  It was a \\nwonderful century. \\n \\n Think now about this century.  For investors to merely match that 5.3% market-value gain, the \\nDow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recently below 13,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would need to close at about 2,000,000 on December 31, 2099.  We are \\nnow eight years into this century, and we have racked up less than 2,000 of the 1,988,000 Dow points the \\nmarket needed to travel in this hundred years to equal the 5.3% of the last. \\n \\n It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amusing that commentators regularly hyperventilate at the prospect of the Dow crossing an \\neven number of thousands, such as 14,000 or 15,000.  If they keep reacting that way, a 5.3% annual gain \\nfor the century will mean they experience at least 1,986 seizures during the next 92 years.  While anything \\nis possible, does anyone really believe this is the most likely outcome? \\n \\n Dividends continue to run about 2%.  Even if stocks were to average the 5.3% annual appreciation \\nof the 1900s, the equity portion of plan assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 allowing for expenses of .5% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would produce no more \\nthan 7% or so.  And .5% may well understate costs, given the presence of layers of consultants and high-\\npriced managers (\\xe2\\x80\\x9chelpers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\n \\n Naturally, everyone expects to be above average.  And those helpers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bless their hearts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will \\ncertainly encourage their clients in this belief.  But, as a class, the helper-aided group must be below \\naverage.  The reason is simple: 1) Investors, overall, will necessarily earn an average return, minus costs \\nthey incur; 2) Passive and index investors, through their very inactivity, will earn that average minus costs \\nthat are very low; 3) With that group earning average returns, so must the remaining group \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the active \\ninvestors.  But this group will incur high transaction, management, and advisory costs.  Therefore, the \\nactive investors will have their returns diminished by a far greater percentage than will their inactive \\nbrethren.  That means that the passive group \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknow-nothings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 must win. \\n \\n I should mention that people who expect to earn 10% annually from equities during this century \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\nenvisioning that 2% of that will come from dividends and 8% from price appreciation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are implicitly \\nforecasting a level of about 24,000,000 on the Dow by 2100.  If your adviser talks to you about double-\\ndigit returns from equities, explain this math to him \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not that it will faze him.  Many helpers are apparently \\ndirect descendants of the queen in Alice in Wonderland, who said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, sometimes I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve believed as many \\nas six impossible things before breakfast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while \\nhe fills his pockets with fees. \\n \\n Some companies have pension plans in Europe as well as in the U.S. and, in their accounting, \\nalmost all assume that the U.S. plans will earn more than the non-U.S. plans.  This discrepancy is puzzling: \\nWhy should these companies not put their U.S. managers in charge of the non-U.S. pension assets and let \\nthem work their magic on these assets as well?  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen this puzzle explained.  But the auditors and \\nactuaries who are charged with vetting the return assumptions seem to have no problem with it. \\n</p>\\n<p> 19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p> What is no puzzle, however, is why CEOs opt for a high investment assumption: It lets them \\nreport higher earnings.  And if they are wrong, as I believe they are, the chickens won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come home to roost \\nuntil long after they retire. \\n \\n After decades of pushing the envelope \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or worse \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in its attempt to report the highest number \\npossible for current earnings, Corporate America should ease up.  It should listen to my partner, Charlie: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf \\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve hit three balls out of bounds to the left, aim a little to the right on the next swing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Whatever pension-cost surprises are in store for shareholders down the road, these jolts will be \\nsurpassed many times over by those experienced by taxpayers.  Public pension promises are huge and, in \\nmany cases, funding is woefully inadequate.  Because the fuse on this time bomb is long, politicians flinch \\nfrom inflicting tax pain, given that problems will only become apparent long after these officials have \\ndeparted.  Promises involving very early retirement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sometimes to those in their low 40s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and generous \\ncost-of-living adjustments are easy for these officials to make.  In a world where people are living longer \\nand inflation is certain, those promises will be anything but easy to keep. \\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \\n Having laid out the failures of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonor system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in American accounting, I need to point out that \\nthis is exactly the system existing at Berkshire for a truly huge balance-sheet item.  In every report we \\nmake to you, we must guesstimate the loss reserves for our insurance units.  If our estimate is wrong, it \\nmeans that both our balance sheet and our earnings statement will be wrong.  So naturally we do our best to \\nmake these guesses accurate.  Nevertheless, in every report our estimate is sure to be wrong. \\n \\n At yearend 2007, we show an insurance liability of $56 billion that represents our guess as to what \\nwe will eventually pay for all loss events that occurred before yearend (except for about $3 billion of the \\nreserve that has been discounted to present value).  We know of many thousands of events and have put a \\ndollar value on each that reflects what we believe we will pay, including the associated costs (such as \\nattorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fees) that we will incur in the payment process.  In some cases, among them claims for certain \\nserious injuries covered by worker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s compensation, payments will be made for 50 years or more. \\n \\n We also include a large reserve for losses that occurred before yearend but that we have yet to hear \\nabout.  Sometimes, the insured itself does not know that a loss has occurred.  (Think of an embezzlement \\nthat remains undiscovered for years.)  We sometimes hear about losses from policies that covered our \\ninsured many decades ago. \\n \\n A story I told you some years back illustrates our problem in accurately estimating our loss \\nliability:  A fellow was on an important business trip in Europe when his sister called to tell him that their \\ndad had died.  Her brother explained that he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get back but said to spare nothing on the funeral, \\nwhose cost he would cover.  When he returned, his sister told him that the service had been beautiful and \\npresented him with bills totaling $8,000.  He paid up but a month later received a bill from the mortuary for \\n$10.  He paid that, too \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and still another $10 charge he received a month later.  When a third $10 invoice \\nwas sent to him the following month, the perplexed man called his sister to ask what was going on.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\nshe replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI forgot to tell you.  We buried Dad in a rented suit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n At our insurance companies we have an unknown, but most certainly large, number of \\xe2\\x80\\x9crented \\nsuits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d buried around the world.  We try to estimate the bill for them accurately.  In ten or twenty years, we \\nwill even be able to make a good guess as to how inaccurate our present guess is.  But even that guess will \\nbe subject to surprises.  I personally believe our stated reserves are adequate, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been wrong several \\ntimes in the past. \\n</p>\\n<p> 20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

If you decide to leave \\nduring the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. \\n \\n The best reason to exit, of course is to shop.  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-\\nsquare-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries.  Last year, the \\n27,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales.  \\nBut you can do better.  (If necessary, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll lock the doors.) \\n \\n This year we will again showcase a Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \\nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that this 1,550-\\nsquare-foot home, priced at $69,500, delivers exceptional value.  And after you purchase the house, \\nconsider also acquiring the Forest River RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. \\n \\n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \\nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \\nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \\nyou money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can. \\n \\n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available \\nfor your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to \\nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel and scissors that you wish on board with \\nyou. \\n \\n Next, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, where you will find about 25 books and \\nDVDs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all discounted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 led again by Poor Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Almanack.

We initiated this special event at NFM \\neleven years ago, and sales during the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30.9 million in 2007.  \\nThis is more volume than most furniture stores register in a year. \\n \\n To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 1st and \\nMonday, May 5th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will \\neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \\ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Our decrease in net worth during 2008 was $11.5 billion, which reduced the per-share book value of\\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 9.6%. Over the last 44 years (that is, since present management took over)\\nbook value has grown from $19 to $70,530, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>The table on the preceding page, recording both the 44-year performance of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value\\nand the S&amp;P 500 index, shows that 2008 was the worst year for each. The period was devastating as well for\\ncorporate and municipal bonds, real estate and commodities. By yearend, investors of all stripes were bloodied\\nand confused, much as if they were small birds that had strayed into a badminton game.\\n</p>\\n<p>As the year progressed, a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great financial\\ninstitutions was unveiled. This led to a dysfunctional credit market that in important respects soon turned\\nnon-functional. The watchword throughout the country became the creed I saw on restaurant walls when I was\\nyoung: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn God we trust; all others pay cash.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>By the fourth quarter, the credit crisis, coupled with tumbling home and stock prices, had produced a\\nparalyzing fear that engulfed the country. A freefall in business activity ensued, accelerating at a pace that I have\\nnever before witnessed. The U.S. \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and much of the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 became trapped in a vicious negative-feedback\\ncycle. Fear led to business contraction, and that in turn led to even greater fear.\\n</p>\\n<p>This debilitating spiral has spurred our government to take massive action. In poker terms, the Treasury\\nand the Fed have gone \\xe2\\x80\\x9call in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recently\\nbeen dispensed by the barrel. These once-unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome\\naftereffects. Their precise nature is anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guess, though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation.\\nMoreover, major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by cities\\nand states bearing mind-boggling requests. Weaning these entities from the public teat will be a political\\nchallenge. They won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave willingly.\\n</p>\\n<p>Whatever the downsides may be, strong and immediate action by government was essential last year if\\nthe financial system was to avoid a total breakdown. Had one occurred, the consequences for every area of our\\neconomy would have been cataclysmic. Like it or not, the inhabitants of Wall Street, Main Street and the various\\nSide Streets of America were all in the same boat.\\n</p>\\n<p>Amid this bad news, however, never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past. In\\nthe 20th Century alone, we dealt with two great wars (one of which we initially appeared to be losing); a dozen or\\nso panics and recessions; virulent inflation that led to a 211\\xe2\\x81\\x842% prime rate in 1980; and the Great Depression of\\nthe 1930s, when unemployment ranged between 15% and 25% for many years. America has had no shortage of\\nchallenges.\\n</p>\\n<p>Without fail, however, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve overcome them. In the face of those obstacles \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and many others \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the\\nreal standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven-fold during the 1900s, while the Dow Jones\\nIndustrials rose from 66 to 11,497. Compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during which\\nhumans secured only tiny gains, if any, in how they lived. Though the path has not been smooth, our economic\\nsystem has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has, and it\\nwill continue to do so. America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best days lie ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Take a look again at the 44-year table on page 2. In 75% of those years, the S&amp;P stocks recorded a\\ngain. I would guess that a roughly similar percentage of years will be positive in the next 44. But neither Charlie\\nMunger, my partner in running Berkshire, nor I can predict the winning and losing years in advance. (In our\\nusual opinionated view, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think anyone else can either.) We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re certain, for example, that the economy will\\nbe in shambles throughout 2009 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, for that matter, probably well beyond \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but that conclusion does not tell\\nus whether the stock market will rise or fall.\\n</p>\\n<p>In good years and bad, Charlie and I simply focus on four goals:\\n</p>\\n<p>(1) maintaining Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gibraltar-like financial position, which features huge amounts of\\nexcess liquidity, near-term obligations that are modest, and dozens of sources of earnings\\nand cash;\\n</p>\\n<p>(2) widening the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around our operating businesses that give them durable competitive\\nadvantages;\\n</p>\\n<p>(3) acquiring and developing new and varied streams of earnings;\\n</p>\\n<p>(4) expanding and nurturing the cadre of outstanding operating managers who, over the years,\\nhave delivered Berkshire exceptional results.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire in 2008\\n</p>\\n<p>Most of the Berkshire businesses whose results are significantly affected by the economy earned below\\ntheir potential last year, and that will be true in 2009 as well. Our retailers were hit particularly hard, as were our\\noperations tied to residential construction. In aggregate, however, our manufacturing, service and retail\\nbusinesses earned substantial sums and most of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 particularly the larger ones \\xe2\\x80\\x93 continue to strengthen their\\ncompetitive positions. Moreover, we are fortunate that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two most important businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our\\ninsurance and utility groups \\xe2\\x80\\x93 produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy. Both\\nbusinesses delivered outstanding results in 2008 and have excellent prospects.\\n</p>\\n<p>As predicted in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report, the exceptional underwriting profits that our insurance businesses\\nrealized in 2007 were not repeated in 2008. Nevertheless, the insurance group delivered an underwriting gain for\\nthe sixth consecutive year. This means that our $58.5 billion of insurance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to\\nus but that we hold and invest for our own benefit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 cost us less than zero. In fact, we were paid $2.8 billion to\\nhold our float during 2008. Charlie and I find this enjoyable.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, most insurers experience a substantial underwriting loss, which makes their economics far\\ndifferent from ours. Of course, we too will experience underwriting losses in some years. But we have the best\\ngroup of managers in the insurance business, and in most cases they oversee entrenched and valuable franchises.\\nConsidering these strengths, I believe that we will earn an underwriting profit over the years and that our float\\nwill therefore cost us nothing. Our insurance operation, the core business of Berkshire, is an economic\\npowerhouse.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I are equally enthusiastic about our utility business, which had record earnings last year\\nand is poised for future gains. Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the managers of this operation, have achieved results\\nunmatched elsewhere in the utility industry. I love it when they come up with new projects because in this\\ncapital-intensive business these ventures are often large. Such projects offer Berkshire the opportunity to put out\\nsubstantial sums at decent returns.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Things also went well on the capital-allocation front last year. Berkshire is always a buyer of both\\nbusinesses and securities, and the disarray in markets gave us a tailwind in our purchases. When investing,\\npessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our insurance portfolios, we made three large investments on terms that would be unavailable in\\nnormal markets. These should add about $11\\xe2\\x81\\x842 billion pre-tax to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual earnings and offer\\npossibilities for capital gains as well. We also closed on our Marmon acquisition (we own 64% of the company\\nnow and will purchase its remaining stock over the next six years). Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries made\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctuck-in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquisitions that will strengthen their competitive positions and earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the good news. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another less pleasant reality: During 2008 I did some dumb things in\\ninvestments. I made at least one major mistake of commission and several lesser ones that also hurt. I will tell\\nyou more about these later. Furthermore, I made some errors of omission, sucking my thumb when new facts\\ncame in that should have caused me to re-examine my thinking and promptly take action.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, the market value of the bonds and stocks that we continue to hold suffered a significant\\ndecline along with the general market. This does not bother Charlie and me. Indeed, we enjoy such price declines\\nif we have funds available to increase our positions. Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrice is what you\\npay; value is what you get.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise\\nwhen it is marked down.\\n</p>\\n<p>Yardsticks\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire has two major areas of value. The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash\\nequivalents. At yearend those totaled $122 billion (not counting the investments held by our finance and utility\\noperations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). About $58.5 billion of that total is funded by our\\ninsurance float.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\\ninsurance. These earnings are delivered by our 67 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 96. We exclude\\nour insurance earnings from this calculation because the value of our insurance operation comes from the\\ninvestable funds it generates, and we have already included this factor in our first bucket.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2008, our investments fell from $90,343 per share of Berkshire (after minority interest) to $77,793, a\\ndecrease that was caused by a decline in market prices, not by net sales of stocks or bonds. Our second segment\\nof value fell from pre-tax earnings of $4,093 per Berkshire share to $3,921 (again after minority interest).\\n</p>\\n<p>Both of these performances are unsatisfactory. Over time, we need to make decent gains in each area if\\nwe are to increase Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value at an acceptable rate. Going forward, however, our focus will be on\\nthe earnings segment, just as it has been for several decades. We like buying underpriced securities, but we like\\nbuying fairly-priced operating businesses even more.\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at the four major operating sectors of Berkshire. Each of these has vastly\\ndifferent balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together, as is done in\\nstandard financial statements, impedes analysis. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how\\nCharlie and I view them.\\n</p>\\n<p>5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Regulated Utility Business\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide\\nvariety of utility operations.

Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some backup for that claim.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our two pipelines, Kern River and Northern Natural, were both acquired in 2002. A firm called Mastio\\nregularly ranks pipelines for customer satisfaction. Among the 44 rated, Kern River came in 9th when we\\npurchased it and Northern Natural ranked 39th. There was work to do.\\n</p>\\n<p>In Mastio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2009 report, Kern River ranked 1st and Northern Natural 3rd. Charlie and I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be more\\nproud of this performance. It came about because hundreds of people at each operation committed themselves to\\na new culture and then delivered on their commitment.\\n</p>\\n<p>Achievements at our electric utilities have been equally impressive. In 1995, MidAmerican became the\\nmajor provider of electricity in Iowa. By judicious planning and a zeal for efficiency, the company has kept\\nelectric prices unchanged since our purchase and has promised to hold them steady through 2013.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>MidAmerican has maintained this extraordinary price stability while making Iowa number one among\\nall states in the percentage of its generation capacity that comes from wind. Since our purchase, MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwind-based facilities have grown from zero to almost 20% of total capacity.\\n</p>\\n<p>Similarly, when we purchased PacifiCorp in 2006, we moved aggressively to expand wind generation.\\nWind capacity was then 33 megawatts. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now 794, with more coming. (Arriving at PacifiCorp, we found\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwind\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a different sort: The company had 98 committees that met frequently. Now there are 28. Meanwhile,\\nwe generate and deliver considerably more electricity, doing so with 2% fewer employees.)\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2008 alone, MidAmerican spent $1.8 billion on wind generation at our two operations, and today the\\ncompany is number one in the nation among regulated utilities in ownership of wind capacity. By the way,\\ncompare that $1.8 billion to the $1.1 billion of pre-tax earnings of PacifiCorp (shown in the table as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWestern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nand Iowa. In our utility business, we spend all we earn, and then some, in order to fulfill the needs of our service\\nareas. Indeed, MidAmerican has not paid a dividend since Berkshire bought into the company in early 2000. Its\\nearnings have instead been reinvested to develop the utility systems our customers require and deserve. In\\nexchange, we have been allowed to earn a fair return on the huge sums we have invested. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great partnership\\nfor all concerned.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Our long-avowed goal is to be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuyer of choice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 particularly those built and owned\\nby families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoid\\nleveraging up acquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companies\\nthrough thick and thin (though we prefer thick and thicker).\\n</p>\\n<p>Our record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path.\\nFor them, acquisitions are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmerchandise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators are\\ncontemplating \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexit strategies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who truly\\ncare about the future of their businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some years back our competitors were known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleveraged-buyout operators.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But LBO became a\\nbad name. So in Orwellian fashion, the buyout firms decided to change their moniker. What they did not change,\\nthough, were the essential ingredients of their previous operations, including their cherished fee structures and\\nlove of leverage.\\n</p>\\n<p>Their new label became \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprivate equity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a name that turns the facts upside-down: A purchase of a\\nbusiness by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductions in the equity portion of the acquiree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncapital structure compared to that previously existing. A number of these acquirees, purchased only two to three\\nyears ago, are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private-equity buyers. Much of\\nthe bank debt is selling below 70\\xc2\\xa2 on the dollar, and the public debt has taken a far greater beating. The private-\\nequity firms, it should be noted, are not rushing in to inject the equity their wards now desperately need. Instead,\\nthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re keeping their remaining funds very private.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the regulated utility field there are no large family-owned businesses. Here, Berkshire hopes to be\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuyer of choice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of regulators. It is they, rather than selling shareholders, who judge the fitness of\\npurchasers when transactions are proposed.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is no hiding your history when you stand before these regulators. They can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 call their\\ncounterparts in other states where you operate and ask how you have behaved in respect to all aspects of the\\nbusiness, including a willingness to commit adequate equity capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>When MidAmerican proposed its purchase of PacifiCorp in 2005, regulators in the six new states we\\nwould be serving immediately checked our record in Iowa. They also carefully evaluated our financing plans and\\ncapabilities. We passed this examination, just as we expect to pass future ones.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are two reasons for our confidence. First, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel are going to run any\\nbusinesses with which they are associated in a first-class manner. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know of any other way to operate.\\nBeyond that is the fact that we hope to buy more regulated utilities in the future \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we know that our business\\nbehavior in jurisdictions where we are operating today will determine how we are welcomed by new jurisdictions\\ntomorrow.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Our insurance group has propelled Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth since we first entered the business in 1967. This\\nhappy result has not been due to general prosperity in the industry. During the 25 years ending in 2007, return on\\nnet worth for insurers averaged 8.5% versus 14.0% for the Fortune 500. Clearly our insurance CEOs have not\\nhad the wind at their back. Yet these managers have excelled to a degree Charlie and I never dreamed possible in\\nthe early days. Why do I love them? Let me count the ways.\\n</p>\\n<p>At GEICO, Tony Nicely \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now in his 48th year at the company after joining it when he was 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\ncontinues to gobble up market share while maintaining disciplined underwriting. When Tony became CEO in\\n1993, GEICO had 2.0% of the auto insurance market, a level at which the company had long been stuck. Now we\\nhave a 7.7% share, up from 7.2% in 2007.\\n</p>\\n<p>The combination of new business gains and an improvement in the renewal rate on existing business\\nhas moved GEICO into the number three position among auto insurers. In 1995, when Berkshire purchased\\ncontrol, GEICO was number seven. Now we trail only State Farm and Allstate.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO grows because it saves money for motorists. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But virtually\\neveryone likes to drive. So, sensibly, drivers look for the lowest-cost insurance consistent with first-class service.\\nEfficiency is the key to low cost, and efficiency is Tony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specialty. Five years ago the number of policies per\\nemployee was 299. In 2008, the number was 439, a huge increase in productivity.\\n</p>\\n<p>As we view GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current opportunities, Tony and I feel like two hungry mosquitoes in a nudist\\ncamp. Juicy targets are everywhere. First, and most important, our new business in auto insurance is now\\nexploding. Americans are focused on saving money as never before, and they are flocking to GEICO. In January\\n2009, we set a monthly record \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by a wide margin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for growth in policyholders. That record will last exactly 28\\ndays: As we go to press, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear February\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain will be even better.\\n</p>\\n<p>Beyond this, we are gaining ground in allied lines. Last year, our motorcycle policies increased by\\n23.4%, which raised our market share from about 6% to more than 7%. Our RV and ATV businesses are also\\ngrowing rapidly, albeit from a small base. And, finally, we recently began insuring commercial autos, a big\\nmarket that offers real promise.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO is now saving money for millions of Americans. Go to GEICO.com or call 1-800-847-7536\\nand see if we can save you money as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>General Re, our large international reinsurer, also had an outstanding year in 2008. Some time back,\\nthe company had serious problems (which I totally failed to detect when we purchased it in late 1998). By 2001,\\nwhen Joe Brandon took over as CEO, assisted by his partner, Tad Montross, General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture had further\\ndeteriorated, exhibiting a loss of discipline in underwriting, reserving and expenses. After Joe and Tad took\\ncharge, these problems were decisively and successfully addressed. Today General Re has regained its luster.\\nLast spring Joe stepped down, and Tad became CEO. Charlie and I are grateful to Joe for righting the ship and\\nare certain that, with Tad, General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future is in the best of hands.\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The underwriting profits signify that all four\\nprovided funds to Berkshire last year without cost, just as they did in 2007. And in both years our underwriting\\nprofitability was considerably better than that achieved by the industry. Of course, we ourselves will periodically\\nhave a terrible year in insurance.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also noteworthy that these operations used only minor\\nfinancial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly we own some terrific businesses. We purchased many of\\nthem, however, at large premiums to net worth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on our balance\\nsheet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 8.1%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though the full-year result was satisfactory, earnings of many of the businesses in this group hit the\\nskids in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth quarter. Prospects for 2009 look worse. Nevertheless, the group retains strong earning\\npower even under today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conditions and will continue to deliver significant cash to the parent company. Overall,\\nthese companies improved their competitive positions last year, partly because our financial strength let us make\\nadvantageous tuck-in acquisitions. In contrast, many competitors were treading water (or sinking).\\n</p>\\n<p>The most noteworthy of these acquisitions was Iscar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s late-November purchase of Tungaloy, a leading\\nJapanese producer of small tools.

Iscar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngrowth since our purchase has exceeded our expectations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which were high \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the addition of Tungaloy will\\nmove performance to the next level.\\n</p>\\n<p>MiTek, Benjamin Moore, Acme Brick, Forest River, Marmon and CTB also made one or more\\nacquisitions during the year. CTB, which operates worldwide in the agriculture equipment field, has now picked\\nup six small firms since we purchased it in 2002. At that time, we paid $140 million for the company. Last year\\nits pre-tax earnings were $89 million. Vic Mancinelli, its CEO, followed Berkshire-like operating principles long\\nbefore our arrival. He focuses on blocking and tackling, day by day doing the little things right and never getting\\noff course. Ten years from now, Vic will be running a much larger operation and, more important, will be\\nearning excellent returns on invested capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\\n</p>\\n<p>I will write here at some length about the mortgage operation of Clayton Homes and skip any financial\\ncommentary, which is summarized in the table at the end of this section. I do this because Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent\\nexperience may be useful in the public-policy debate about housing and mortgages. But first a little background.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clayton is the largest company in the manufactured home industry, delivering 27,499 units last year.\\nThis came to about 34% of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 81,889 total. Our share will likely grow in 2009, partly because much\\nof the rest of the industry is in acute distress. Industrywide, units sold have steadily declined since they hit a peak\\nof 372,843 in 1998.\\n</p>\\n<p>10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '10': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>At that time, much of the industry employed sales practices that were atrocious. Writing about the\\nperiod somewhat later, I described it as involving \\xe2\\x80\\x9cborrowers who shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have borrowed being financed by\\nlenders who shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have lent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>To begin with, the need for meaningful down payments was frequently ignored. Sometimes fakery was\\ninvolved. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat certainly looks like a $2,000 cat to me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says the salesman who will receive a $3,000\\ncommission if the loan goes through.) Moreover, impossible-to-meet monthly payments were being agreed to by\\nborrowers who signed up because they had nothing to lose. The resulting mortgages were usually packaged\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9csecuritized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and sold by Wall Street firms to unsuspecting investors. This chain of folly had to end badly, and\\nit did.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clayton, it should be emphasized, followed far more sensible practices in its own lending throughout\\nthat time. Indeed, no purchaser of the mortgages it originated and then securitized has ever lost a dime of\\nprincipal or interest. But Clayton was the exception; industry losses were staggering. And the hangover continues\\nto this day.\\n</p>\\n<p>This 1997-2000 fiasco should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-larger\\nconventional housing market. But investors, government and rating agencies learned exactly nothing from the\\nmanufactured-home debacle. Instead, in an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated with\\nconventional homes in the 2004-07 period: Lenders happily made loans that borrowers couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repay out of their\\nincomes, and borrowers just as happily signed up to meet those payments.

This is not because these borrowers are unusually creditworthy, a point proved\\nby FICO scores (a standard measure of credit risk). Their median FICO score is 644, compared to a national\\nmedian of 723, and about 35% are below 620, the segment usually designated \\xe2\\x80\\x9csub-prime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Many disastrous\\npools of mortgages on conventional homes are populated by borrowers with far better credit, as measured by\\nFICO scores.\\n</p>\\n<p>Yet at yearend, our delinquency rate on loans we have originated was 3.6%, up only modestly from\\n2.9% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2004. (In addition to our originated loans, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also bought bulk portfolios of various\\ntypes from other financial institutions.) Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreclosures during 2008 were 3.0% of originated loans\\ncompared to 3.8% in 2006 and 5.3% in 2004.\\n</p>\\n<p>Why are our borrowers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 characteristically people with modest incomes and far-from-great credit\\nscores \\xe2\\x80\\x93 performing so well? The answer is elementary, going right back to Lending 101. Our borrowers simply\\nlooked at how full-bore mortgage payments would compare with their actual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not hoped-for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 income and then\\ndecided whether they could live with that commitment. Simply put, they took out a mortgage with the intention\\nof paying it off, whatever the course of home prices.\\n</p>\\n<p>Just as important is what our borrowers did not do. They did not count on making their loan payments\\nby means of refinancing. They did not sign up for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cteaser\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rates that upon reset were outsized relative to their\\nincome. And they did not assume that they could always sell their home at a profit if their mortgage payments\\nbecame onerous. Jimmy Stewart would have loved these folks.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, a number of our borrowers will run into trouble. They generally have no more than minor\\nsavings to tide them over if adversity hits. The major cause of delinquency or foreclosure is the loss of a job, but\\ndeath, divorce and medical expenses all cause problems. If unemployment rates rise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as they surely will in\\n2009 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more of Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borrowers will have troubles, and we will have larger, though still manageable, losses.\\nBut our problems will not be driven to any extent by the trend of home prices.\\n</p>\\n<p>11</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Tax-Exempt Bond Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Early in 2008, we activated Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Company (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBHAC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) as an insurer of the\\ntax-exempt bonds issued by states, cities and other local entities. BHAC insures these securities for issuers both\\nat the time their bonds are sold to the public (primary transactions) and later, when the bonds are already owned\\nby investors (secondary transactions).\\n</p>\\n<p>By yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business had\\nall fallen into big trouble. The cause of their problems was captured long ago by Mae West: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was Snow White,\\nbut I drifted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The monolines (as the bond insurers are called) initially insured only tax-exempt bonds that were\\nlow-risk. But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell. Faced with the prospect of\\nstagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever-riskier propositions. Some of these\\ninvolved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations. When housing prices plummeted, the monoline\\nindustry quickly became a basket case.\\n</p>\\n<p>Early in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax-exempts that was on\\nthe books of the three largest monolines. These companies were all in life-threatening trouble (though they said\\notherwise.) We would have charged a 11\\xe2\\x81\\x842% rate to take over the guarantees on about $822 billion of bonds. If\\nour offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who owned\\nthese bonds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases. Ours was not a frivolous proposal: For reasons\\nwe will come to later, it involved substantial risk for Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>The monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two. In the end,\\nthough, the turndowns proved to be very good news for us, because it became apparent that I had severely\\nunderpriced our offer.\\n</p>\\n<p>Thereafter, we wrote about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market. And here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the punch\\nline: About 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementioned\\nmonolines. In these agreements, we have to pay for defaults only if the original insurer is financially unable to do\\nso.\\n</p>\\n<p>We wrote this \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecond-to-pay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d insurance for rates averaging 3.3%. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right; we have been paid far\\nmore for becoming the second to pay than the 1.5% we would have earlier charged to be the first to pay. In one\\nextreme case, we actually agreed to be fourth to pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1% premium\\ncharged by the monoline that remains first to pay. In other words, three other monolines have to first go broke\\nbefore we need to write a check.\\n</p>\\n<p>Two of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital.\\nThis, of course, directly helps us, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term,\\nany claims on our second-to-pay insurance because these two monolines fail. In addition to our book of\\nsecondary business, we have also written $3.7 billion of primary business for a premium of $96 million. In\\nprimary business, of course, we are first to pay if the issuer gets in trouble.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any other\\nmonoline. Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs. This explains why many sophisticated\\ninvestors have bought second-to-pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by another\\nmonoline. BHAC has become not only the insurer of preference, but in many cases the sole insurer acceptable to\\nbondholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a sure\\nthing that this insurance will ultimately be profitable for us. The reason is simple, though I have never seen even\\na passing reference to it by any financial analyst, rating agency or monoline CEO.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax-exempts has been that defaults have\\nhistorically been few. But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsured bonds.\\nInsurance of tax-exempt bonds didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist before 1971, and even after that most bonds remained uninsured.\\n</p>\\n<p>A universe of tax-exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat different\\nloss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being how different.\\nTo understand why, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy. At the time its\\nbonds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 virtually all uninsured \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were heavily held by the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wealthier residents as well as by New York\\nbanks and other institutions. These local bondholders deeply desired to solve the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiscal problems. So before\\nlong, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution. Without one, it\\nwas apparent to all that New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severe\\nfinancial losses from their bond holdings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, imagine that all of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire. Would similar belt-\\ntightening, tax increases, labor concessions, etc. have been forthcoming? Of course not. At a minimum, Berkshire\\nwould have been asked to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshare\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the required sacrifices. And, considering our deep pockets, the required\\ncontribution would most certainly have been substantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>Local governments are going to face far tougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date.\\nThe pension liabilities I talked about in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report will be a huge contributor to these woes. Many cities\\nand states were surely horrified when they inspected the status of their funding at yearend 2008. The gap between\\nassets and a realistic actuarial valuation of present liabilities is simply staggering.\\n</p>\\n<p>When faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will be\\nmore prone to develop \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolutions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsured\\nbonds held by local banks and residents. Losses in the tax-exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to be\\nhighly correlated among issuers. If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance that\\nothers will follow in their footsteps will grow. What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to local\\ncitizens in the form of major tax increases over pain to a far-away bond insurer?\\n</p>\\n<p>Insuring tax-exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one with similarities, in\\nfact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes. In both cases, a string of loss-free years can be followed by a\\ndevastating experience that more than wipes out all earlier profits. We will try, therefore, to proceed carefully in\\nthis business, eschewing many classes of bonds that other monolines regularly embrace.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>The type of fallacy involved in projecting loss experience from a universe of non-insured bonds onto a\\ndeceptively-similar universe in which many bonds are insured pops up in other areas of finance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBack-tested\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmodels of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error. Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financial\\nmarkets as guides to future action. (If merely looking up past financial data would tell you what the future holds,\\nthe Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Indeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed,\\nhistory-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors. These parties looked at loss experience\\nover periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then made\\nthis experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had\\nrecently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford.\\nIn short, universe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpast\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and universe \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccurrent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had very different characteristics.

I know of no reporting mechanism\\nthat would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives.\\nAuditors can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t audit these contracts, and regulators can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t regulate them. When I read the pages of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisclosure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\n10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what is\\ngoing on in their portfolios (and then I reach for some aspirin).\\n</p>\\n<p>For a case study on regulatory effectiveness, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look harder at the Freddie and Fannie example.\\nThese giant institutions were created by Congress, which retained control over them, dictating what they could\\nand could not do. To aid its oversight, Congress created OFHEO in 1992, admonishing it to make sure the two\\nbehemoths were behaving themselves. With that move, Fannie and Freddie became the most intensely-regulated\\ncompanies of which I am aware, as measured by manpower assigned to the task.\\n</p>\\n<p>On June 15, 2003, OFHEO (whose annual reports are available on the Internet) sent its 2002 report to\\nCongress \\xe2\\x80\\x93 specifically to its four bosses in the Senate and House, among them none other than Messrs. Sarbanes\\nand Oxley. The report\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 127 pages included a self-congratulatory cover-line: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCelebrating 10 Years of\\nExcellence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The transmittal letter and report were delivered nine days after the CEO and CFO of Freddie had\\nresigned in disgrace and the COO had been fired. No mention of their departures was made in the letter, even\\nwhile the report concluded, as it always did, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth Enterprises were financially sound and well managed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>In truth, both enterprises had engaged in massive accounting shenanigans for some time. Finally, in\\n2006, OFHEO issued a 340-page scathing chronicle of the sins of Fannie that, more or less, blamed the fiasco on\\nevery party but \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you guessed it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Congress and OFHEO.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Bear Stearns collapse highlights the counterparty problem embedded in derivatives transactions, a\\ntime bomb I first discussed in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2002 report. On April 3, 2008, Tim Geithner, then the able president of\\nthe New York Fed, explained the need for a rescue: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sudden discovery by Bear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s derivative counterparties\\nthat important financial positions they had put in place to protect themselves from financial risk were no longer\\noperative would have triggered substantial further dislocation in markets. This would have precipitated a rush by\\nBear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counterparties to liquidate the collateral they held against those positions and to attempt to replicate those\\npositions in already very fragile markets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is Fedspeak for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe stepped in to avoid a financial chain reaction\\nof unpredictable magnitude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In my opinion, the Fed was right to do so.\\n</p>\\n<p>A normal stock or bond trade is completed in a few days with one party getting its cash, the other its\\nsecurities. Counterparty risk therefore quickly disappears, which means credit problems can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accumulate. This\\nrapid settlement process is key to maintaining the integrity of markets. That, in fact, is a reason for NYSE and\\nNASDAQ shortening the settlement period from five days to three days in 1995.\\n</p>\\n<p>Derivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterparties\\nbuilding up huge claims against each other. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPaper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assets and liabilities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 often hard to quantify \\xe2\\x80\\x93 become\\nimportant parts of financial statements though these items will not be validated for many years. Additionally, a\\nfrightening web of mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions. Receivables and payables by\\nthe billions become concentrated in the hands of a few large dealers who are apt to be highly-leveraged in other\\nways as well. Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal\\ndisease: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.\\n</p>\\n<p>17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Sleeping around, to continue our metaphor, can actually be useful for large derivatives dealers because\\nit assures them government aid if trouble hits. In other words, only companies having problems that can infect\\nthe entire neighborhood \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention names \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are certain to become a concern of the state (an outcome, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\nsad to say, that is proper). From this irritating reality comes The First Law of Corporate Survival for ambitious\\nCEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: Modest incompetence simply\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mindboggling screw-ups that are required.\\n</p>\\n<p>Considering the ruin I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve pictured, you may wonder why Berkshire is a party to 251 derivatives\\ncontracts (other than those used for operational purposes at MidAmerican and the few left over at Gen Re). The\\nanswer is simple: I believe each contract we own was mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so. I both\\ninitiated these positions and monitor them, a set of responsibilities consistent with my belief that the CEO of any\\nlarge financial organization must be the Chief Risk Officer as well. If we lose money on our derivatives, it will be\\nmy fault.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our derivatives dealings require our counterparties to make payments to us when contracts are\\ninitiated. Berkshire therefore always holds the money, which leaves us assuming no meaningful counterparty\\nrisk. As of yearend, the payments made to us less losses we have paid \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our derivatives \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so to speak \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\ntotaled $8.1 billion. This float is similar to insurance float: If we break even on an underlying transaction, we will\\nhave enjoyed the use of free money for a long time. Our expectation, though it is far from a sure thing, is that we\\nwill do better than break even and that the substantial investment income we earn on the funds will be frosting on\\nthe cake.\\n</p>\\n<p>Only a small percentage of our contracts call for any posting of collateral when the market moves\\nagainst us. Even under the chaotic conditions existing in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth quarter, we had to post less than 1% of\\nour securities portfolio. (When we post collateral, we deposit it with third parties, meanwhile retaining the\\ninvestment earnings on the deposited securities.) In our 2002 annual report, we warned of the lethal threat that\\nposting requirements create, real-life illustrations of which we witnessed last year at a variety of financial\\ninstitutions (and, for that matter, at Constellation Energy, which was within hours of bankruptcy when\\nMidAmerican arrived to effect a rescue).\\n</p>\\n<p>Our contracts fall into four major categories. With apologies to those who are not fascinated by\\nfinancial instruments, I will explain them in excruciating detail.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We have added modestly to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequity put\\xe2\\x80\\x9d portfolio I described in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report. Some of our\\ncontracts come due in 15 years, others in 20. We must make a payment to our counterparty at\\nmaturity if the reference index to which the put is tied is then below what it was at the inception of\\nthe contract. Neither party can elect to settle early; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only the price on the final day that counts.\\n</p>\\n<p>To illustrate, we might sell a $1 billion 15-year put contract on the S&amp;P 500 when that index is at,\\nsay, 1300. If the index is at 1170 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 down 10% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on the day of maturity, we would pay $100 million.\\nIf it is above 1300, we owe nothing. For us to lose $1 billion, the index would have to go to zero. In\\nthe meantime, the sale of the put would have delivered us a premium \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps $100 million to\\n$150 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we would be free to invest as we wish.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our put contracts total $37.1 billion (at current exchange rates) and are spread among four major\\nindices: the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S., the FTSE 100 in the U.K., the Euro Stoxx 50 in Europe, and the\\nNikkei 225 in Japan. Our first contract comes due on September 9, 2019 and our last on January 24,\\n2028. We have received premiums of $4.9 billion, money we have invested. We, meanwhile, have\\npaid nothing, since all expiration dates are far in the future. Nonetheless, we have used Black-\\nScholes valuation methods to record a yearend liability of $10 billion, an amount that will change\\non every reporting date. The two financial items \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this estimated loss of $10 billion minus the $4.9\\nbillion in premiums we have received \\xe2\\x80\\x93 means that we have so far reported a mark-to-market loss\\nof $5.1 billion from these contracts.\\n</p>\\n<p>18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>We endorse mark-to-market accounting. I will explain later, however, why I believe the Black-\\nScholes formula, even though it is the standard for establishing the dollar liability for options,\\nproduces strange results when the long-term variety are being valued.\\n</p>\\n<p>One point about our contracts that is sometimes not understood: For us to lose the full $37.1 billion\\nwe have at risk, all stocks in all four indices would have to go to zero on their various termination\\ndates. If, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as an example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all indices fell 25% from their value at the inception of each\\ncontract, and foreign-exchange rates remained as they are today, we would owe about $9 billion,\\npayable between 2019 and 2028. Between the inception of the contract and those dates, we would\\nhave held the $4.9 billion premium and earned investment income on it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The second category we described in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report concerns derivatives requiring us to pay\\nwhen credit losses occur at companies that are included in various high-yield indices. Our standard\\ncontract covers a five-year period and involves 100 companies. We modestly expanded our position\\nlast year in this category. But, of course, the contracts on the books at the end of 2007 moved one\\nyear closer to their maturity. Overall, our contracts now have an average life of 21\\xe2\\x81\\x843 years, with the\\nfirst expiration due to occur on September 20, 2009 and the last on December 20, 2013.\\n</p>\\n<p>By yearend we had received premiums of $3.4 billion on these contracts and paid losses of $542\\nmillion. Using mark-to-market principles, we also set up a liability for future losses that at yearend\\ntotaled $3.0 billion. Thus we had to that point recorded a loss of about $100 million, derived from\\nour $3.5 billion total in paid and estimated future losses minus the $3.4 billion of premiums we\\nreceived. In our quarterly reports, however, the amount of gain or loss has swung wildly from a\\nprofit of $327 million in the second quarter of 2008 to a loss of $693 million in the fourth quarter of\\n2008.\\n</p>\\n<p>Surprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only $97 million last year, far below the\\nestimate I used when I decided to enter into them. This year, however, losses have accelerated\\nsharply with the mushrooming of large bankruptcies. In last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter, I told you I expected these\\ncontracts to show a profit at expiration. Now, with the recession deepening at a rapid rate, the\\npossibility of an eventual loss has increased. Whatever the result, I will keep you posted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In 2008 we began to write \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredit default swaps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on individual companies. This is simply credit\\ninsurance, similar to what we write in BHAC, except that here we bear the credit risk of\\ncorporations rather than of tax-exempt issuers.\\n</p>\\n<p>If, say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a $100 million contract, we are\\nobligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndebt. (If, for example, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe $70\\nmillion.) For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which our\\ninsurance expires.\\n</p>\\n<p>At yearend we had written $4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receive\\nannual premiums of $93 million. This is the only derivatives business we write that has any\\ncounterparty risk; the party that buys the contract from us must be good for the quarterly premiums\\nit will owe us over the five years. We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent because\\nmost buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter into\\nsuch an arrangement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 At the request of our customers, we write a few tax-exempt bond insurance contracts that are\\nsimilar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives. The only meaningful\\ndifference between the two contracts is that mark-to-market accounting is required for derivatives\\nwhereas standard accrual accounting is required at BHAC.\\n</p>\\n<p>19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>But this difference can produce some strange results. The bonds covered \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in effect, insured \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by\\nthese derivatives are largely general obligations of states, and we feel good about them. At yearend,\\nhowever, mark-to-market accounting required us to record a loss of $631 million on these\\nderivatives contracts. Had we instead insured the same bonds at the same price in BHAC, and used\\nthe accrual accounting required at insurance companies, we would have recorded a small profit for\\nthe year. The two methods by which we insure the bonds will eventually produce the same\\naccounting result. In the short term, however, the variance in reported profits can be substantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have told you before that our derivative contracts, subject as they are to mark-to-market\\naccounting, will produce wild swings in the earnings we report.

Indeed, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdowns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be helpful in that they give us an opportunity to expand a position on\\nfavorable terms. I hope this explanation of our dealings will lead you to think similarly.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>The Black-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it when\\nvaluing our equity put options for financial statement purposes. Key inputs to the calculation include a contract\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmaturity and strike price, as well as the analyst\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectations for volatility, interest rates and dividends.\\n</p>\\n<p>If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness,\\nBlack and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoring\\nwhatever caveats the two men attached when they first unveiled the formula.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often useful in testing a theory to push it to extremes. So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1\\nbillion put option on the S&amp;P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied\\nvolatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and\\ndividend assumptions, we would find the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&amp;P will be valued a century\\nfrom now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only\\n2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14\\xc2\\xa2). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher.\\nFar more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of\\nmost of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about\\n175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.\\n</p>\\n<p>Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year\\nperiod to be far less than 1%. But let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should one\\noccur \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5\\nmillion ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).\\n</p>\\n<p>But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to\\ninvest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have\\nbeen profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay\\nnothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\nis, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my\\nassumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.\\n</p>\\n<p>20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion\\nof volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around\\nin some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probability-\\nweighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote every\\nday on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing\\nquotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farm\\na century from now.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Though historical volatility is a useful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but far from foolproof \\xe2\\x80\\x93 concept in valuing short-term options,\\nits utility diminishes rapidly as the duration of the option lengthens.

This is not desirable from a safety standpoint,\\nnor do we believe that sprinting ability should be the determinant of who gets to pose questions. (At age 78, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nconcluded that speed afoot is a ridiculously overrated talent.) Again, a new procedure is desirable.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our first change, several financial journalists from organizations representing newspapers,\\nmagazines and television will participate in the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that\\nshareholders have submitted by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune,\\nwho may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com,\\nand Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted,\\neach journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. (In your\\ne-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\\njournalists will pick some tough ones and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we like it.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our second change, we will have a drawing at 8:15 at each microphone for those shareholders\\nhoping to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with\\nthose from the winning shareholders. At least half the questions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those selected by the panel from your\\nsubmissions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are therefore certain to be Berkshire-related. We will meanwhile continue to get some good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\nperhaps entertaining \\xe2\\x80\\x93 questions from the audience as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>So join us at our Woodstock for Capitalists and let us know how you like the new format. Charlie and I\\nlook forward to seeing you.\\n</p>\\n<p>February 27, 2009 Warren E. Buffett\\nChairman of the Board\\n</p>\\n<p>23</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>'},\n",

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2009 was $21.8 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both\\nour Class A and Class B stock by 19.8%. Over the last 45 years (that is, since present management took over)\\nbook value has grown from $19 to $84,487, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has added at least 65,000\\nshareholders to the 500,000 or so already on our books. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to Charlie Munger, my long-time partner,\\nand me that all of our owners understand Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations, goals, limitations and culture. In each annual\\nreport, consequently, we restate the economic principles that guide us. This year these principles appear on pages\\n89-94 and I urge all of you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but particularly our new shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to read them. Berkshire has adhered to these\\nprinciples for decades and will continue to do so long after I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gone.\\n</p>\\n<p>In this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business, hoping to provide both a freshman\\norientation session for our BNSF newcomers and a refresher course for Berkshire veterans.\\n</p>\\n<p>How We Measure Ourselves\\n</p>\\n<p>Our metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start,\\nCharlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or have\\nnot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 accomplished. That keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then\\npainting the bull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye around it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Selecting the S&amp;P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can\\nmatch its performance by holding an index fund. Why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result?\\n</p>\\n<p>A more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&amp;P. There are\\ngood arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that is\\nthe best test. But year-to-year market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. Even evaluations covering as long as a\\ndecade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurement\\nperiod. Steve Ballmer, of Microsoft, and Jeff Immelt, of GE, can tell you about that problem, suffering as they do\\nfrom the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton.\\n</p>\\n<p>The ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic\\nvalue. Alas, that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision, so we instead use a crude proxy for\\nit: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93.\\nAdditionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case at\\nBerkshire. In aggregate, our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried on\\nour books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and I\\nbelieve that our book value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 understated though it is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 supplies the most useful tracking device for changes in\\nintrinsic value. By this measurement, as the opening paragraph of this letter states, our book value since the start\\nof fiscal 1965 has grown at a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.\\n</p>\\n<p>*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\\n1/1500th of those shown for A.\\n</p>\\n<p>3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>We should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results would\\nlook better, showing a gain since the start of fiscal 1965 of 22% compounded annually. Surprisingly, this modest\\ndifference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year period\\ncompared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965\\nBerkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereas\\ntoday Berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its first-class businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>Summed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First,\\nwe have never had any five-year period beginning with 1965-69 and ending with 2005-09 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and there have been\\n41 of these \\xe2\\x80\\x93 during which our gain in book value did not exceed the S&amp;P\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain. Second, though we have lagged\\nthe S&amp;P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&amp;P in the\\neleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than our\\noffense, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely to continue.\\n</p>\\n<p>The big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown, an\\nunpleasant trend that is certain to continue. To be sure, Berkshire has many outstanding businesses and a cadre of\\ntruly great managers, operating within an unusual corporate culture that lets them maximize their talents. Charlie\\nand I believe these factors will continue to produce better-than-average results over time. But huge sums forge\\ntheir own anchor and our future advantage, if any, will be a small fraction of our historical edge.\\n</p>\\n<p>What We Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Do\\n</p>\\n<p>Long ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll I want to know is where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to die, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\nnever go there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvert, always invert\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approach\\nworks on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and\\nwife.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Here are a few examples of how we apply Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinking at Berkshire:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t evaluate, no matter how exciting their\\nproducts may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth\\nthat awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950). But\\nthe future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the\\ncompanies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding.\\n</p>\\n<p>Just because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean\\nwe can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battle\\nfor supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to\\ncome seems reasonably predictable. Even then, we will make plenty of mistakes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback\\nposition at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cash\\nwe may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be\\nconstantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier\\nof liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured\\n$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government for\\nhelp. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secure\\nAmerican businesses that needed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 without delay \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our tangible vote of confidence. The remaining\\n$6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that was\\ncompleted without pause while, elsewhere, panic reigned.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>We pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash-\\nequivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. But we sleep well.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising and\\nmonitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting management\\nproblems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlie\\nand I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use the\\nindependence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner-\\noriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rather\\nsuffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come from\\ndecisions made too slowly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or not at all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because of a stifling bureaucracy.\\n</p>\\n<p>With our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds of\\ndifferent operating units. We hope to have many more of each. But we will never allow Berkshire\\nto become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiple\\nlayers of management. Instead, we plan to operate as a collection of separately-managed medium-\\nsized and large businesses, most of whose decision-making occurs at the operating level. Charlie\\nand I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers and\\nsetting their compensation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We make no attempt to woo Wall Street. Investors who buy and sell based upon media or analyst\\ncommentary are not for us. Instead we want partners who join us at Berkshire because they wish\\nto make a long-term investment in a business they themselves understand and because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one that\\nfollows policies with which they concur. If Charlie and I were to go into a small venture with a\\nfew partners, we would seek individuals in sync with us, knowing that common goals and a shared\\ndestiny make for a happy business \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarriage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between owners and managers. Scaling up to giant\\nsize doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change that truth.\\n</p>\\n<p>To build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directly\\nand informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions were\\nreversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on the\\nInternet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during a\\nnon-trading period to digest just what has happened at our multi-faceted enterprise. (Occasionally,\\nSEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be adequately\\nsummarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline that\\njournalists sometimes seek.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830\\nwords in the annual letter was this sentence: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are certain, for example, that the economy will\\nbe in shambles throughout 2009 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and probably well beyond \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but that conclusion does not tell us\\nwhether the market will rise or fall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Many news organizations reported \\xe2\\x80\\x93 indeed, blared \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the first\\npart of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terrible\\njournalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I were\\nforecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but also\\nelsewhere, made it clear we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t predicting the market at all.

We have four major operating sectors, each\\ndiffering from the others in balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together,\\nas is standard in financial statements, impedes analysis. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which\\nis how Charlie and I view them.\\n</p>\\n<p>5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Our property-casualty (P/C) insurance business has been the engine behind Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth and will\\ncontinue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion more\\nthan their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d account. These companies, however, are\\nworth far more than their carrying value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the following look at the economic model of the P/C industry will\\ntell you why.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from\\ncertain workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model\\nleaves us holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to\\ninvest this float for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float\\nwe hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does\\nour float.\\n</p>\\n<p>If premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that\\nadds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of free\\nmoney \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition,\\nso vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in some\\ncatastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use of\\nfloat.\\n</p>\\n<p>In my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will\\nabsolutely state that we have the best managers. Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we entered\\nthe business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for\\nseven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though\\ncertainly not all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billion\\nwith us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not a result to be expected for the P/C industry as a\\nwhole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\\nindustry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&amp;P\\n500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running some\\nunusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars to\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pleasure for me to tell you about these all-stars.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising\\nbudget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by Tony\\nNicely, who joined the company at 18. Now 66, Tony still tap-dances to the office every day, just as I do at 79.\\nWe both feel lucky to work at a business we love.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proof: Since Berkshire\\nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the net\\naddition of seven million policyholders. Perhaps they contacted us because they thought our gecko was cute, but\\nthey bought from us to save important money. (Maybe you can as well; call 1-800-847-7536 or go to\\nwww.GEICO.com.) And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire acquired GEICO in two stages. In 1976-80 we bought about one-third of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstock for $47 million. Over the years, large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position to\\ngrow to about 50% without our having bought any more shares. Then, on January 2, 1996, we acquired the\\nremaining 50% of GEICO for $2.3 billion in cash, about 50 times the cost of our original purchase.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>An old Wall Street joke gets close to our experience:\\n</p>\\n<p>Customer: Thanks for putting me in XYZ stock at 5. I hear it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to 18.\\n</p>\\n<p>Broker: Yes, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the beginning. In fact, the company is doing so well now,\\nthat it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an even better buy at 18 than it was when you made your purchase.\\n</p>\\n<p>Customer: Damn, I knew I should have waited.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth may slow in 2010. U.S. vehicle registrations are actually down because of slumping\\nauto sales. Moreover, high unemployment is causing a growing number of drivers to go uninsured. (That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s illegal\\nalmost everywhere, but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost your job and still want to drive . . .) Our \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow-cost producer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d status,\\nhowever, is sure to give us significant gains in the future. In 1995, GEICO was the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sixth largest auto\\ninsurer; now we are number three. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float has grown from $2.7 billion to $9.6 billion. Equally\\nimportant, GEICO has operated at an underwriting profit in 13 of the 14 years Berkshire has owned it.\\n</p>\\n<p>I became excited about GEICO in January 1951, when I first visited the company as a 20-year-old\\nstudent. Thanks to Tony, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m even more excited today.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>A hugely important event in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came into\\nour office in Omaha \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I immediately knew we had found a superstar. (He had been discovered by Mike\\nGoldberg, now elevated to St. Mike.)\\n</p>\\n<p>We immediately put Ajit in charge of National Indemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small and struggling reinsurance operation.\\nOver the years, he has built this business into a one-of-a-kind giant in the insurance world.\\n</p>\\n<p>Staffed today by only 30 people, Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operation has set records for transaction size in several areas of\\ninsurance. Ajit writes billion-dollar limits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then keeps every dime of the risk instead of laying it off with\\nother insurers. Three years ago, he took over huge liabilities from Lloyds, allowing it to clean up its relationship\\nwith 27,972 participants (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnames\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) who had written problem-ridden policies that at one point threatened the\\nsurvival of this 322-year-old institution. The premium for that single contract was $7.1 billion. During 2009, he\\nnegotiated a life reinsurance contract that could produce $50 billion of premium for us over the next 50 or so\\nyears.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business is just the opposite of GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. At that company, we have millions of small policies\\nthat largely renew year after year. Ajit writes relatively few policies, and the mix changes significantly from year\\nto year. Throughout the world, he is known as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needs\\nto be insured.\\n</p>\\n<p>If Charlie, I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you can only save one of us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 swim to Ajit.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Our third insurance powerhouse is General Re. Some years back this operation was troubled; now it is\\na gleaming jewel in our insurance crown.\\n</p>\\n<p>Under the leadership of Tad Montross, General Re had an outstanding underwriting year in 2009, while\\nalso delivering us unusually large amounts of float per dollar of premium volume. Alongside General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s P/C\\nbusiness, Tad and his associates have developed a major life reinsurance operation that has grown increasingly\\nvaluable.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year General Re finally attained 100% ownership of Cologne Re, which since 1995 has been a\\nkey \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though only partially-owned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 part of our presence around the world. Tad and I will be visiting Cologne in\\nSeptember to thank its managers for their important contribution to Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Finally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, the\\nfloat they provide us is substantial.

Unfortunately, I finally succeeded, coming up with a brilliant insight that we should market\\nour own credit card. I reasoned that GEICO policyholders were likely to be good credit risks and, assuming we\\noffered an attractive card, would likely favor us with their business. We got business all right \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but of the wrong\\ntype.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our pre-tax losses from credit-card operations came to about $6.3 million before I finally woke up. We\\nthen sold our $98 million portfolio of troubled receivables for 55\\xc2\\xa2 on the dollar, losing an additional $44 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers, it should be emphasized, were never enthusiastic about my idea.

I subtly indicated that I was older and wiser.\\n</p>\\n<p>I was just older.\\n</p>\\n<p>Regulated Utility Business\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire has an 89.5% interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of\\nutility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million end\\nusers make it the U.K.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 725,000\\nelectric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million\\nelectric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about\\n8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.\\n</p>\\n<p>MidAmerican has two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel. In addition, my long-time friend,\\nWalter Scott, along with his family, has a major ownership position in the company. Walter brings extraordinary\\nbusiness savvy to any operation. Ten years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have reinforced my original\\nbelief: Berkshire couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have better partners. They are truly a dream team.\\n</p>\\n<p>Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the\\nU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000\\nagents. Though last year was again a terrible year for home sales, HomeServices earned a modest sum. It also\\nacquired a firm in Chicago and will add other quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible\\nprices.

Permitting and construction periods for generation and major transmission facilities\\nstretch way out, so it is incumbent on us to be far-sighted. We, in turn, look to our utilities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regulators (acting on\\nbehalf of our customers) to allow us an appropriate return on the huge amounts of capital we must deploy to meet\\nfuture needs. We shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours.\\n</p>\\n<p>Dave and Greg make sure we do just that. National research companies consistently rank our Iowa and\\nWestern utilities at or near the top of their industry. Similarly, among the 43 U.S. pipelines ranked by a firm\\nnamed Mastio, our Kern River and Northern Natural properties tied for second place.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for\\nthe future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. Since we purchased MidAmerican ten\\nyears ago, it has never paid a dividend. We have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties in\\neach of the territories we serve. As one dramatic example, in the last three years our Iowa and Western utilities\\nhave earned $2.5 billion, while in this same period spending $3 billion on wind generation facilities.\\n</p>\\n<p>MidAmerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and, to society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit, it has\\nreciprocated: With few exceptions, our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever-\\nincreasing sums of capital we must invest. Going forward, we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories in\\nthe manner they expect. We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds we\\ninvest.\\n</p>\\n<p>In earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the\\nbest businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require little\\nincremental investment to grow. We are fortunate to own a number of such businesses, and we would love to buy\\nmore. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quite\\nwilling to enter businesses that regularly require large capital expenditures. We expect only that these businesses\\nhave reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectations\\nare met \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we believe that they will be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever-growing collection of good to great businesses\\nshould produce above-average, though certainly not spectacular, returns in the decades ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Our BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemble\\nthose of our electric utilities. In both cases we provide fundamental services that are, and will remain, essential to\\nthe economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will require\\nheavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan far\\nahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulators\\nwho will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investments\\nrequired to maintain, replace and expand the plant.\\n</p>\\n<p>We see a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial compact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the case\\nwith our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties to\\nthe compact should \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we believe will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages good\\nbehavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economic\\npotential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems.

The major exception was McLane, our distributor of groceries, confections and\\nnon-food items to thousands of retail outlets, the largest by far Wal-Mart.\\n</p>\\n<p>Grady Rosier led McLane to record pre-tax earnings of $344 million, which even so amounted to only\\nslightly more than one cent per dollar on its huge sales of $31.2 billion. McLane employs a vast array of physical\\nassets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 practically all of which it owns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 including 3,242 trailers, 2,309 tractors and 55 distribution centers with\\n15.2 million square feet of space. McLane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime asset, however, is Grady.\\n</p>\\n<p>We had a number of companies at which profits improved even as sales contracted, always an\\nexceptional managerial achievement.

Brown (manufacturing and retailing of shoes) Jim Issler\\nCTB (agricultural equipment) Vic Mancinelli\\nDairy Queen John Gainor\\nNebraska Furniture Mart (furniture retailing) Ron and Irv Blumkin\\nPampered Chef (direct sales of kitchen tools) Marla Gottschalk\\nSee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (manufacturing and retailing of candy) Brad Kinstler\\nStar Furniture (furniture retailing) Bill Kimbrell\\n</p>\\n<p>Among the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector, both\\nMarmon and Iscar turned in relatively strong performances. Frank Ptak\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-tax\\nprofit margin, a record high. Though the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales were down 27%, Frank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cost-conscious management\\nmitigated the decline in earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nothing stops Israel-based Iscar \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not wars, recessions or competitors. The world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two other leading\\nsuppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of the\\nyear. Though Iscar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, even\\nwhile it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about last\\nyear. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of Eitan\\nWertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny Goldman will see to that.\\n</p>\\n<p>Every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely\\nin 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an\\n82.5% decline from $1.295 billion in 2006, when construction activity was booming. These businesses continue\\nto bump along the bottom, though their competitive positions remain undented.\\n</p>\\n<p>The major problem for Berkshire last year was NetJets, an aviation operation that offers fractional\\nownership of jets. Over the years, it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier company\\nin its industry, with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined. Overall, our\\ndominance in the field remains unchallenged.\\n</p>\\n<p>NetJets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business operation, however, has been another story. In the eleven years that we have owned\\nthe company, it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million. Moreover, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt has soared\\nfrom $102 million at the time of purchase to $1.9 billion in April of last year. Without Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guarantee of\\nthis debt, NetJets would have been out of business. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear that I failed you in letting NetJets descend into this\\ncondition.

       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Dave Sokol, the enormously talented builder and operator of MidAmerican Energy, became CEO of\\nNetJets in August. His leadership has been transforming: Debt has already been reduced to $1.4 billion, and, after\\nsuffering a staggering loss of $711 million in 2009, the company is now solidly profitable.\\n</p>\\n<p>Most important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-line\\nstandards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 previous CEO and the father of the fractional-\\nownership industry, insisted upon. Dave and I have the strongest possible personal interest in maintaining these\\nstandards because we and our families use NetJets for almost all of our flying, as do many of our directors and\\nmanagers. None of us are assigned special planes nor crews. We receive exactly the same treatment as any other\\nowner, meaning we pay the same prices as everyone else does when we are using our personal contracts. In short,\\nwe eat our own cooking. In the aviation business, no other testimonial means more.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\\n</p>\\n<p>Our largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading producer of modular and\\nmanufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers were\\nFleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All have\\nsince gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000 units in 1999 to 60,000 units in\\n2009.\\n</p>\\n<p>The industry is in shambles for two reasons, the first of which must be lived with if the U.S. economy\\nis to recover. This reason concerns U.S. housing starts (including apartment units). In 2009, starts were 554,000,\\nby far the lowest number in the 50 years for which we have data. Paradoxically, this is good news.\\n</p>\\n<p>People thought it was good news a few years back when housing starts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the supply side of the picture\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 were running about two million annually. But household formations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the demand side \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only amounted to\\nabout 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too many\\nhouses.\\n</p>\\n<p>There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the\\ndestruction of autos that occurred with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccash-for-clunkers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program; (2) speed up household formations by,\\nsay, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reduce\\nnew housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential\\nhousing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certain\\nlocalities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. Prices will remain far below \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbubble\\xe2\\x80\\x9d levels, of course,\\nbut for every seller (or lender) hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. Indeed, many families that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nafford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst.\\n</p>\\n<p>The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive\\ndifferential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let me\\nunderscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary that\\nfollows with special care. That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problems\\nfor both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton.\\n</p>\\n<p>The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie\\nMac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typically\\nbe securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers of\\nconventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 51\\xe2\\x81\\x844%. In\\naddition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, an\\naction that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels.\\n</p>\\n<p>In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a\\nmeritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nhomes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, of course, most buyers do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the\\ndifference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home.\\n</p>\\n<p>12</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Last year I told you why our buyers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 generally people with low incomes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 performed so well as credit\\nrisks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it.\\nConsequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nmaking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs, had\\nhealth problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simply\\nbecause house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delinquencies and\\ndefaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have tried to qualify more of our customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans for treatment similar to those available on the\\nsite-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsible\\nhabits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to the\\nfactory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t broadened, so as to open\\nlow-cost financing to all who meet down-payment and income standards, the manufactured-home industry seems\\ndestined to struggle and dwindle.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though well\\nbelow its potential. We couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a better manager than CEO Kevin Clayton, who treats Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests\\nas if they were his own. Our product is first-class, inexpensive and constantly being improved. Moreover, we will\\ncontinue to use Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit to support Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mortgage program, convinced as we are of its soundness.\\nEven so, Berkshire can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t borrow at a rate approaching that available to government agencies. This handicap will\\nlimit sales, hurting both Clayton and a multitude of worthy families who long for a low-cost home.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the following table, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings are net of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s payment to Berkshire for the use of\\nits credit. Offsetting this cost to Clayton is an identical amount of income credited to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finance\\noperation and included in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOther Income.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cost and income amount was $116 million in 2009 and $92\\nmillion in 2008.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table also illustrates how severely our furniture (CORT) and trailer (XTRA) leasing operations\\nhave been hit by the recession.

Our derivatives float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float I\\ndescribed earlier \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was about $6.3 billion at yearend.\\n</p>\\n<p>(2) Only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. At last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low\\npoint in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of the\\nderivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put up\\ncontinue to earn money for our account.\\n</p>\\n<p>(3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect\\nour reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings.\\nThat thought certainly fit 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses from\\nderivatives valuations that were part of our reported earnings last year:\\n</p>\\n<p>Quarter $ Gain (Loss) in Billions\\n</p>\\n<p>1 (1.517)\\n2 2.357\\n3 1.732\\n4 1.052\\n</p>\\n<p>As we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report to\\nyou, we will continue to separate out these figures (as we do realized investment gains and losses) so that you can\\nmore clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivatives\\ncontracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide.

At\\nBerkshire nothing like that has occurred \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nor will it.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my job to keep Berkshire far away from such problems. Charlie and I believe that a CEO must not\\ndelegate risk control. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor every derivatives\\ncontract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such as\\nMidAmerican, and the minor runoff contracts at General Re. If Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be my fault.\\nIt will not be because of misjudgments made by a Risk Committee or Chief Risk Officer.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>In my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its\\nCEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incapable of handling that job, he should look for other\\nemployment. And if he fails at it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nthe financial consequences for him and his board should be severe.\\n</p>\\n<p>It has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest financial\\ninstitutions. Yet they have borne the burden, with 90% or more of the value of their holdings wiped out in most\\ncases of failure. Collectively, they have lost more than $500 billion in just the four largest financial fiascos of the\\nlast two years. To say these owners have been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbailed-out\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to make a mockery of the term.\\n</p>\\n<p>The CEOs and directors of the failed companies, however, have largely gone unscathed. Their fortunes may\\nhave been diminished by the disasters they oversaw, but they still live in grand style. It is the behavior of these\\nCEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by their\\nrecklessness, they should pay a heavy price \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one not reimbursable by the companies they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve damaged nor by\\ninsurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; some\\nmeaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>An Inconvenient Truth (Boardroom Overheating)\\n</p>\\n<p>Our subsidiaries made a few small \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbolt-on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquisitions last year for cash, but our blockbuster deal\\nwith BNSF required us to issue about 95,000 Berkshire shares that amounted to 6.1% of those previously\\noutstanding. Charlie and I enjoy issuing Berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy.\\n</p>\\n<p>The reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at the\\ncurrent market price, why in the world should we \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a significant part of the company at that same inadequate\\nprice by issuing our stock in a merger?\\n</p>\\n<p>In evaluating a stock-for-stock offer, shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus on\\nthe market price of the acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares that are to be given them. But they also expect the transaction to deliver\\nthem the intrinsic value of their own shares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the ones they are giving up. If shares of a prospective acquirer are\\nselling below their intrinsic value, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an all-stock deal. You\\nsimply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exchange an undervalued stock for a fully-valued one without hurting your shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Imagine, if you will, Company A and Company B, of equal size and both with businesses intrinsically\\nworth $100 per share. Both of their stocks, however, sell for $80 per share. The CEO of A, long on confidence\\nand short on smarts, offers 11\\xe2\\x81\\x844 shares of A for each share of B, correctly telling his directors that B is worth $100\\nper share. He will neglect to explain, though, that what he is giving will cost his shareholders $125 in intrinsic\\nvalue. If the directors are mathematically challenged as well, and a deal is therefore completed, the shareholders\\nof B will end up owning 55.6% of A &amp; B\\xe2\\x80\\x99s combined assets and A\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shareholders will own 44.4%. Not everyone\\nat A, it should be noted, is a loser from this nonsensical transaction. Its CEO now runs a company twice as large\\nas his original domain, in a world where size tends to correlate with both prestige and compensation.\\n</p>\\n<p>16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>If an acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock is overvalued, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a different story: Using it as a currency works to the acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nadvantage. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances of\\nstock by sly promoters. Going by the market value of their stock, they can afford to overpay because they are, in\\neffect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960s\\nhaving been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in this\\nway. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there is\\nplenty of private snickering.)\\n</p>\\n<p>In our BNSF acquisition, the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at $100 per share.\\nThe cost to us, however, was somewhat higher since 40% of the $100 was delivered in our shares, which Charlie\\nand I believed to be worth more than their market value. Fortunately, we had long owned a substantial amount of\\nBNSF stock that we purchased in the market for cash. All told, therefore, only about 30% of our cost overall was\\npaid with Berkshire shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock was\\noffset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood and\\nliked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. We\\nalso like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the final\\ndecision was a close one. If we had needed to use more stock to make the acquisition, it would in fact have made\\nno sense. We would have then been giving up more than we were getting.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>I have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with the\\ndirectors being instructed by high-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?). Invariably, the bankers\\ngive the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased, with emphasis on why it is\\nworth far more than its market price. In more than fifty years of board memberships, however, never have I heard\\nthe investment bankers (or management!) discuss the true value of what is being given. When a deal involved the\\nissuance of the acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock, they simply used market value to measure the cost. They did this even though\\nthey would have argued that the acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price was woefully inadequate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 absolutely no indicator of its\\nreal value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had a takeover bid for the acquirer instead been the subject up for discussion.\\n</p>\\n<p>When stock is the currency being contemplated in an acquisition and when directors are hearing from\\nan advisor, it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors should\\nhire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not\\ngoing through. Absent this drastic remedy, our recommendation in respect to the use of advisors remains: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nask the barber whether you need a haircut.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resist telling you a true story from long ago. We owned stock in a large well-run bank that for\\ndecades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bank\\nimmediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fine people and able bankers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not\\nunexpectedly began to behave like teenage boys who had just discovered girls.\\n</p>\\n<p>They soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristics\\nin such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why\\nwe had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio. Alongside,\\nthough, the small-bank owner was being wooed by other large banks in the state and was holding out for a price\\nclose to three times book value. Moreover, he wanted stock, not cash.\\n</p>\\n<p>Naturally, our fellows caved in and agreed to this value-destroying deal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need to show that we are\\nin the hunt. Besides, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only a small deal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said, as if only major harm to shareholders would have been a\\nlegitimate reason for holding back. Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reaction at the time: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre we supposed to applaud because the dog\\nthat fouls our lawn is a Chihuahua rather than a Saint Bernard?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The seller of the smaller bank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no fool \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then delivered one final demand in his negotiations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter\\nthe merger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he in effect said, perhaps using words that were phrased more diplomatically than these, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going\\nto be a large shareholder of your bank, and it will represent a huge portion of my net worth. You have to promise\\nme, therefore, that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never again do a deal this dumb.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Yes, the merger went through.

In all other respects, the results are calculated using\\nthe numbers originally reported.\\n</p>\\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire\\nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500\\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index\\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>2</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>The per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the\\nlast 46 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $95,453, a rate of\\n20.2% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working\\nout even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nearning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share\\ncount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this\\ntransaction have turned out very well.\\n</p>\\n<p>A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal year,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire\\nand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earning\\npower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business\\nclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and\\nseveral others that I will explain in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvestment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of the\\nassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or\\nlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future because railroads have major cost and environmental\\nadvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record\\n500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means\\nour railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced\\ngreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full\\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better\\nsituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our\\nchecks will clear.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we demonstrated our enthusiasm\\nfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,\\n$5.4 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or 90% of the total \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad in\\nthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a new\\nrecord for capital spending \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $8 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and spend all of the $2 billion increase in the United States.\\n</p>\\n<p>Money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.\\nCommentators today often talk of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat uncertainty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But think back, for example, to December 6,\\n1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always\\nuncertain.\\n</p>\\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly\\nmoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than\\nwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential\\nis far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a system that has worked wonders\\nfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remains alive and\\neffective.\\n</p>\\n<p>We are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. But\\nlook around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and\\n1941, America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best days lie ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>Performance\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish\\nperformance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot\\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-eye around wherever it lands.\\n</p>\\n<p>In Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate\\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&amp;P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,\\nif we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves could\\nhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.\\n</p>\\n<p>The challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me\\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possible.\\n</p>\\n<p>To eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 book value \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying\\nvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swings\\nwildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&amp;P, a performance quite good in the earlier\\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums of\\ncapital we currently manage eliminate any chance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for\\nbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard.\\n</p>\\n<p>Yearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of\\nthe earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or\\noperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year on\\nadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amount\\nproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many large\\ninvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road.\\n</p>\\n<p>To provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly\\nfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tell\\nan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980s. The market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s golden period,\\nhowever, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative\\nadvantage narrowed.\\n</p>\\n<p>After 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory\\nperformance relative to the S&amp;P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute\\nresults.\\n</p>\\n<p>Looking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&amp;P \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though that result is, of\\ncourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results in\\nbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nvalue.\\n</p>\\n<p>The first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend these\\ntotaled $158 billion at market value.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nfunds $66 billion of our investments. This float is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaning\\nthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile,\\nswinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been significantly\\nprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of our\\ninvestments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those funded both by float and by retained earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can be viewed as an element of value for\\nBerkshire shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\\ninsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106.\\nIn Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that will\\ncontinue.\\n</p>\\n<p>The following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investments\\napplicable to minority interests.\\n</p>\\n<p>Yearend\\nPer-Share\\n</p>\\n<p>Investments Period\\nCompounded Annual Increase\\n</p>\\n<p>in Per-Share Investments\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 66\\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 754 1970-1980 27.5%\\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,798 1980-1990 26.3%\\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50,229 1990-2000 20.5%\\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 94,730 2000-2010 6.6%\\n</p>\\n<p>Though our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the\\n40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operating\\nbusinesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>The payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our\\nnon-insurance businesses have increased, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests.\\n</p>\\n<p>Year\\nPer-Share\\n</p>\\n<p>Pre-Tax Earnings Period\\nCompounded Annual Increase in\\n</p>\\n<p>Per-Share Pre-Tax Earnings\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2.87\\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . 19.01 1970-1980 20.8%\\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . 102.58 1980-1990 18.4%\\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . 918.66 1990-2000 24.5%\\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,926.04 2000-2010 20.5%\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>For the forty years, our compounded annual gain in pre-tax, non-insurance earnings per share is 21.0%.\\nDuring the same period, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price increased at a rate of 22.1% annually. Over time, you can expect\\nour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsic\\nvalue often follow very different paths \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sometimes for extended periods \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but eventually they meet.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many other\\nbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presently\\nemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dollars into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.\\n</p>\\n<p>This \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat-will-they-do-with-the-money\\xe2\\x80\\x9d factor must always be evaluated along with the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat-do-we-have-now\\xe2\\x80\\x9d calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nintrinsic value. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current value; if the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talents or motives are suspect, today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value must be discounted. The\\ndifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or Montgomery\\nWard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at a\\ndecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from our\\ncurrent businesses and more major acquisitions. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my\\ntrigger finger is itchy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Partially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a\\ncadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.\\nMany of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They are\\nvolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be lured\\naway.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at\\nheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years\\n(it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managers\\nto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in people\\nrather than process. A \\xe2\\x80\\x9chire well, manage little\\xe2\\x80\\x9d code suits both them and me.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MBAs; others never finished college. Some use\\nbudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squad\\ncomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the\\nneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves to\\nreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniverse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.\\nCompetition for the few opportunities that are available tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, as\\na girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be great\\nfor the girl, but terrible for the boys.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and frequently we\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>When I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in\\ntextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was to\\npursue \\xe2\\x80\\x9copportunities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to improve and expand the existing textile operation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so for years that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what I\\ndid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh!\\nEventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the\\nattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available in\\nmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculously\\nhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securities\\nand bide our time.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We have\\nbeen able to take money we earn from, say, See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, but\\nalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,\\nculture counts.\\n</p>\\n<p>To start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide them\\ndirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess up\\nwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families own\\nBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions and results\\nwith keen interest and an owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards.\\n</p>\\n<p>This same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who have\\nsought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to us\\nwith an owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managers\\nwho love their businesses is no small advantage.\\n</p>\\n<p>Cultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou shape your houses and then they shape\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperial\\ncorporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no longer CEO when you\\nget in the back seat of your car and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) At Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorld Headquarters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d our annual rent is\\n$270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech\\nequipment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you name it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own,\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers are likely to be careful with it as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our compensation programs, our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with an\\neye to reinforcing the Berkshire culture, and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent.\\nThis culture grows stronger every year, and it will remain intact long after Charlie and I have left the scene.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will need all of the strengths I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just described to do reasonably well. Our managers will deliver;\\nyou can count on that. But whether Charlie and I can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on the\\ncompetitive environment for acquisitions. You will get our best efforts.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\n</p>\\n<p>Now let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far\\nexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories.\\n</p>\\n<p>Sixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a\\n20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a\\nonce-a-week class at the school.\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>One day at the library, I checked out Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entry in Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Who in America and found he was\\nchairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had\\nnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, after\\nreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train for\\nWashington.\\n</p>\\n<p>Alas, when I arrived at the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I could\\ntalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.\\n</p>\\n<p>That was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gave me an education about both\\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated from\\nColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which got\\nme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon after\\nmeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Subsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got\\ninto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the stock falling by\\nmore than 95% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the years\\nincreased to 50% because of GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cost for this half of the business\\nwas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)\\n</p>\\n<p>We then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,\\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside with\\nBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNext time, Warren, please make an appointment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>A lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 saving Americans substantial\\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 or\\nwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this\\nobjective, the company has grown to be America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.\\n</p>\\n<p>When Tony Nicely, GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had\\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistent\\ngrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me quantify Tony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already\\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangible\\nnet worth of $1.9 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $2.7 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was what we estimated\\nGEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders\\nwho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in\\npremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were\\nannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary\\ninsurer: Because of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.\\n</p>\\n<p>Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our\\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO\\nincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value\\ndecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick we\\napplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And this\\nvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO \\xe2\\x80\\x93 off to a strong start in 2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is the\\ngift that keeps giving.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>One not-so-small footnote: Under Tony, GEICO has developed one of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest personal-\\nlines insurance agencies, which primarily sells homeowners policies to our GEICO auto insurance customers. In\\nthis business, we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. They take the risk; we simply sign\\nup the customers. Last year we sold 769,898 new policies at this agency operation, up 34% from the year before.\\nThe obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue; equally important is the fact that it\\nfurther strengthens our relationship with our policyholders, helping us retain them.\\n</p>\\n<p>I owe an enormous debt to Tony and Davy (and, come to think of it, to that janitor as well).\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them\\nas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will look first at insurance, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core operation and the engine that has propelled our\\nexpansion over the years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Property-casualty (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cP/C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to\\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims\\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.\\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the\\nfollowing table:\\n</p>\\n<p>Yearend\\nFloat\\n</p>\\n<p>(in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 39\\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 237\\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,632\\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,871\\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65,832\\n</p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free\\nmoney \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a\\nsignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\\nFarm, by far the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in\\nseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite\\nprofitably in most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though certainly not all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than\\ncost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holding\\nits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\\n</p>\\n<p>10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '10': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\\nwhole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\\nindustry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by\\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outstanding economics exist only\\nbecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already told you about GEICO,\\nbut we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>First off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one\\nelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most\\nimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks\\nthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative than most large insurers\\nin that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annual\\npremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades.\\n</p>\\n<p>From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion and\\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By his\\naccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonite\\nbounces off Ajit.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of all exposures\\nthat might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually\\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,\\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if the\\nappropriate premium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from\\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes has\\nled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other guy is doing it so we must as well\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spells\\ntrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge\\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, the\\nfloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\\n</p>\\n<p>Underwriting Profit Yearend Float\\n</p>\\n<p>(in millions)\\nInsurance Operations 2010 2009 2010 2009\\n</p>\\n<p>General Re . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 452 $ 477 $20,049 $21,014\\nBH Reinsurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 176 250 30,370 27,753\\nGEICO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,117 649 10,272 9,613\\nOther Primary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 268 84 5,141 5,061\\n</p>\\n<p>$2,013 $1,460 $65,832 $63,441\\n</p>\\n<p>Among large insurance operations, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impresses me as the best in the world.\\n</p>\\n<p>11</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Some of the businesses\\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to\\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor\\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about\\nbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics of\\nthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes\\nmy eyesight has been poor.\\n</p>\\n<p>Most of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look\\nfirst at the record-breakers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)\\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, with\\nNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes are\\npedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exceptional performance is created\\nby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\\n</p>\\n<p>12</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\\nas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter).\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no need; Pete Liegl, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products at\\nthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Report\\nabout Vic Mancinelli, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 million\\nfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt.\\nLast year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. When\\nwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a new\\nrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim has\\nbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by Frank\\nRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golf\\ncourse.\\n</p>\\n<p>A huge story in this sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overstate the\\nbreadth and importance of Dave Sokol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional\\nownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five times\\nthat of its nearest competitor. Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanics\\nand service personnel. This crew again did its job in 2010, with customer satisfaction, as delineated in our regular\\nsurveys, hitting new highs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its\\nacquisition in 1998, were a failure. In the 11 years through 2009, the company reported an aggregate pre-tax loss\\nof $157 million, a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at NetJets were heavily subsidized by its\\nfree use of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit. Had NetJets been operating on a stand-alone basis, its loss over the years would\\nhave been several hundreds of millions greater.\\n</p>\\n<p>We are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guarantee. Despite this fee (which\\ncame to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918 million from 2009.\\nDave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quick restructuring of management and the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rationalization of its purchasing and spending\\npolicies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only major business problem into a\\nsolidly profitable operation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Dave has meanwhile maintained NetJets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 industry-leading reputation for safety and service. In many\\nimportant ways, our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the FAA.\\nMaintaining top-of-the-line standards is the right thing to do, but I also have a selfish reason for championing this\\npolicy. My family and I have flown more than 5,000 hours on NetJets (that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equal to being airborne 24 hours a\\nday for seven months) and will fly thousands of hours more in the future. We receive no special treatment and\\nhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know we\\nare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation.\\n</p>\\n<p>The largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130\\nbusinesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchase\\nof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase the\\nremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmon\\nwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Next to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years.\\nIn 2010, Grady Rosier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billion\\noperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, an\\noperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dynamic CEO. David is\\nleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wine\\nand Spirits in Tennessee.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Sales\\nare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny\\nGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main competitors.\\n</p>\\n<p>All that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle.\\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits are\\nfar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010\\ncompared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400.\\n</p>\\n<p>A housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at some\\npoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the past\\neleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for\\n$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed next\\nyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. These\\nbusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever.\\n</p>\\n<p>Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\\n</p>\\n<p>We have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common\\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this\\nletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\\n</p>\\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\\nassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\\nnot needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply covers\\ntheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s car loadings far off peak levels, the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest coverage was 6:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\\ninvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn the\\nrespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earn\\nreasonable earnings on future capital investments.\\n</p>\\n<p>Earlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future. Rail moves 42% of\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about 28%\\nof the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of all inter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S.\\nis transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher.\\n</p>\\n<p>All of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American\\neconomy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along with\\nits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs, not\\nmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,\\nwith this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our huge\\nincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin.\\n</p>\\n<p>At MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial compact.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We are expected to put up ever-\\nincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, we\\nknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\\n</p>\\n<p>14</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>MidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport\\n8% of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day.\\n</p>\\n<p>MidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest is 89.8%) and its\\ncustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent\\nreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\\n</p>\\n<p>In its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since we\\npurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state has\\nraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the two\\nutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told that\\ncomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area.\\n</p>\\n<p>MidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, more\\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested or\\ncommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican\\nretains all of its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn.\\n</p>\\n<p>As you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\\nBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican.

       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>All three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in aggregate about $1.4 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\\nreduced. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the bad news.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least\\n$500 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and perhaps much more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields\\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an\\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come too soon for me: To update\\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen\\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though\\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength\\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fault the Fed: For\\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\\n</p>\\n<p>At some point, probably soon, the Fed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just\\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\\n</p>\\n<p>Other companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In\\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I\\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be surprised to see our share of\\nCoke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\\nbusiness.\\n</p>\\n<p>Overall, I believe our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Last summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an age Charlie and\\nI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 his call was a surprise.\\n</p>\\n<p>Lou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been\\ninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates only\\nbecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?\\n</p>\\n<p>Lou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\\ngreats. We will miss him.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Four years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on\\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediately\\navailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though\\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved is\\ncrucial, as is the manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and sensitivity to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 risk (which in no way should be measured by\\nbeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with a\\nhard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,\\nwe wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job.\\n</p>\\n<p>18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>When Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with\\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&amp;P. We have\\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by\\nundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have\\nreceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their\\nlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started\\nanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past\\nlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\\n</p>\\n<p>As long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holdings, both bonds\\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can reset\\nannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to\\nrequire style boxes such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9clong-short,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmacro,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternational equities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At Berkshire our only style box is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own\\nportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for\\nindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\\n</p>\\n<p>When Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful\\nperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but not to have a vote \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on the\\nwisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\\n</p>\\n<p>One footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s joining us, a number of commentators\\npointed out that he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9clittle-known\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and expressed puzzlement that we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seek a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig-name.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I wonder\\nhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goal\\nwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that may not be the smartest\\nmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Derivatives\\n</p>\\n<p>Two years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives\\ncontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over at\\nGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and the\\nunwinding or expiration of some contracts.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.\\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assuming\\nrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are\\nidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front when\\nwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor\\nexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\\n</p>\\n<p>In aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderwriting\\nprofit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we would\\nbenefit from the use of float.\\n</p>\\n<p>19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Subsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A\\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,\\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, it\\nappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have had\\nthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged the\\nright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our other large derivatives position \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whose contracts go by the name of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequity puts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 involves\\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the\\nU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S.\\nand the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of these\\ncontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination date\\ncounts: No payments can be required before then.\\n</p>\\n<p>As a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally\\nreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.\\nConsequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that\\n$647 million for about three years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>The future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nand foreign exchange rates are unchanged \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to\\n2026. You can call this amount \\xe2\\x80\\x9csettlement value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>On our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will record\\na $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion and\\nthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability will\\nfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,\\nof course, is far from a sure thing.\\n</p>\\n<p>What is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of $4.2 billion for an average of about\\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance float\\nfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase\\nof BNSF.\\n</p>\\n<p>As I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\\ncollateral \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling\\ncomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.\\nForegoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Reporting and Misreporting: The Numbers That Count and Those That Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\n</p>\\n<p>Earlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire and\\nmeasuring its progress.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net\\nincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire.\\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could \\xe2\\x80\\x93 quite legally \\xe2\\x80\\x93 cause net income in any\\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like.\\n</p>\\n<p>20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Our net\\nincome \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which would count only the loss \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would be reported as less than our operating income. If we had\\nmeanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% when\\nin reality our business might be much improved.\\n</p>\\n<p>If we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because\\nwe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I have\\nnever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We both\\nhave a deep disgust for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgame playing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate America\\nin the 1990s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to.\\n</p>\\n<p>Operating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how our\\nbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But if\\nyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.\\nPay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on the\\nright track.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>As a p.s., I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity puts\\nhad a termination date of June 30, 2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties at\\nthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figure\\ndown to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts\\nrequired us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change\\nthat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to\\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our\\nmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that\\nthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.\\n</p>\\n<p>We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is\\nthe accepted standard for option valuation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost all leading business schools teach it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we would be\\naccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an\\ninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-\\nScholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of\\nboth their values and ours were the two far apart.\\n</p>\\n<p>Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.\\nCharlie and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that\\ncalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come up with an exact figure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 anymore than we can come up with a\\nprecise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.\\n</p>\\n<p>John Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They\\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly.\\nWitness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and\\n1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it \\xe2\\x80\\x9canomalies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (I always love explanations of that kind:\\nThe Flat Earth Society probably views a ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential,\\nanomaly.)\\n</p>\\n<p>21</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '21': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Academics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 current practice of teaching Black-Scholes as revealed truth needs re-examination. For that\\nmatter, so does the academic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as\\nan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to\\nvalue a business. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what investing is all about.\\n</p>\\n<p>Life and Debt\\n</p>\\n<p>The fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is\\nequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\nclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, very\\nfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and some relearned in\\n2008 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by a\\nsingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smart\\npeople.\\n</p>\\n<p>Leverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that\\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either\\nbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by\\npayment. For that, only cash will do the job.\\n</p>\\n<p>Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.\\nWhen either is missing, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all that is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.\\nIn September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously close\\nto bringing our entire country to its knees.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I have no interest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-\\nbeing. (With our having a combined age of 167, starting over is not on our bucket list.) We are forever conscious\\nof the fact that you, our partners, have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. In\\naddition, important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. Finally, many disabled victims of accidents\\ncaused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now. It would be irresponsible\\nfor us to risk what all these constituencies need just to pursue a few points of extra return.\\n</p>\\n<p>A little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nmeet Charlie until he was 35, though he grew up within 100 yards of where I have lived for 52 years and also\\nattended the same inner-city public high school in Omaha from which my father, wife, children and two\\ngrandchildren graduated. Charlie and I did, however, both work as young boys at my grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grocery store,\\nthough our periods of employment were separated by about five years. My grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was Ernest, and\\nperhaps no man was more aptly named. No one worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped by\\nthe experience.\\n</p>\\n<p>On the facing page you can read a letter sent in 1939 by Ernest to his youngest son, my Uncle Fred.\\nSimilar letters went to his other four children. I still have the letter sent to my Aunt Alice, which I found \\xe2\\x80\\x93 along\\nwith $1,000 of cash \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when, as executor of her estate, I opened her safe deposit box in 1970.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ernest never went to business school \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he never in fact finished high school \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but he understood the\\nimportance of liquidity as a condition for assured survival. At Berkshire, we have taken his $1,000 solution a bit\\nfurther and have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash, excluding that held at our regulated utility\\nand railroad businesses. Because of that commitment, we customarily keep at least $20 billion on hand so that we\\ncan both withstand unprecedented insurance losses (our largest to date having been about $3 billion from Katrina,\\nthe insurance industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most expensive catastrophe) and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities,\\neven during times of financial turmoil.\\n</p>\\n<p>22</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Here are the highlights:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The primary job of a Board of Directors is to see that the right people are running the business and to\\nbe sure that the next generation of leaders is identified and ready to take over tomorrow. I have been on\\n19 corporate boards, and Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s directors are at the top of the list in the time and diligence they\\nhave devoted to succession planning. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, their efforts have paid off.\\n</p>\\n<p>As 2011 started, Todd Combs joined us as an investment manager, and shortly after yearend Ted\\nWeschler came aboard. Both of these men have outstanding investment skills and a deep commitment\\nto Berkshire. Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgment\\nand character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Your Board is equally enthusiastic about my successor as CEO, an individual to whom they have had a\\ngreat deal of exposure and whose managerial and human qualities they admire. (We have two superb\\nback-up candidates as well.) When a transfer of responsibility is required, it will be seamless, and\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospects will remain bright. More than 98% of my net worth is in Berkshire stock, all of\\nwhich will go to various philanthropies. Being so heavily concentrated in one stock defies conventional\\nwisdom. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m fine with this arrangement, knowing both the quality and diversity of the businesses\\nwe own and the caliber of the people who manage them. With these assets, my successor will enjoy a\\nrunning start. Do not, however, infer from this discussion that Charlie and I are going anywhere; we\\ncontinue to be in excellent health, and we love what we do.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 On September 16th we acquired Lubrizol, a worldwide producer of additives and other specialty\\nchemicals. The company has had an outstanding record since James Hambrick became CEO in 2004,\\nwith pre-tax profits increasing from $147 million to $1,085 million. Lubrizol will have many\\nopportunities for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbolt-on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquisitions in the specialty chemical field. Indeed, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already agreed to\\nthree, costing $493 million. James is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. Charlie and I are eager\\nto expand his managerial domain.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Our major businesses did well last year. In fact, each of our five largest non-insurance companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 BNSF,\\nIscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 delivered record operating earnings. In\\naggregate these businesses earned more than $9 billion pre-tax in 2011. Contrast that to seven years ago,\\nwhen we owned only one of the five, MidAmerican, whose pre-tax earnings were $393 million. Unless the\\neconomy weakens in 2012, each of our fabulous five should again set a record, with aggregate earnings\\ncomfortably topping $10 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In total, our entire string of operating companies spent $8.2 billion for property, plant and equipment in\\n2011, smashing our previous record by more than $2 billion. About 95% of these outlays were made in\\nthe U.S., a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. We\\nwelcome projects abroad, but expect the overwhelming majority of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future capital\\ncommitments to be in America. In 2012, these expenditures will again set a record.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Our insurance operations continued their delivery of costless capital that funds a myriad of other\\nopportunities. This business produces \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to us, but that we get to\\ninvest for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive in\\npremiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing.\\nThough we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve now had nine consecutive\\nyears of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion. Over the same nine years our float increased\\nfrom $41 billion to its current record of $70 billion. Insurance has been good to us.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Finally, we made two major investments in marketable securities: (1) a $5 billion 6% preferred stock of\\nBank of America that came with warrants allowing us to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per\\nshare any time before September 2, 2021; and (2) 63.9 million shares of IBM that cost us $10.9 billion.\\nCounting IBM, we now have large ownership interests in four exceptional companies: 13.0% of\\nAmerican Express, 8.8% of Coca-Cola, 5.5% of IBM and 7.6% of Wells Fargo. (We also, of course,\\nhave many smaller, but important, positions.)\\n</p>\\n<p>We view these holdings as partnership interests in wonderful businesses, not as marketable securities to\\nbe bought or sold based on their near-term prospects. Our share of their earnings, however, are far from\\nfully reflected in our earnings; only the dividends we receive from these businesses show up in our\\nfinancial reports. Over time, though, the undistributed earnings of these companies that are attributable\\nto our ownership are of huge importance to us. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because they will be used in a variety of ways to\\nincrease future earnings and dividends of the investee. They may also be devoted to stock repurchases,\\nwhich will increase our share of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Had we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Four\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would\\nhave been $862 million. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all that would have been reported in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s income statement. Our\\nshare of this quartet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings, however, would have been far greater: $3.3 billion. Charlie and I\\nbelieve that the $2.4 billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value for\\nBerkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. We expect the combined earnings of the four \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\ntheir dividends as well \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time to\\ncome. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earnings\\nof $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve run out of good news. Here are some developments that hurt us during 2011:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 A few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, an\\nelectric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a big mistake. In large measure,\\nthe company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase and\\nremains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since our\\npurchase, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. We\\nwrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year.\\n</p>\\n<p>At yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at present\\nlevels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our current\\ncarrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or even\\nall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities when\\nI purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called away from us by their issuers in\\n2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeem\\nsecurities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of\\nincome to replace, though our Lubrizol purchase did offset most of it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Last year, I told you that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I was dead\\nwrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. The\\nconnection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country,\\naccounting for about 7% of those constructed during 2011.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products,\\nprimarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. In\\naggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsimilar to 2010 but down from $1.8 billion in 2006.\\n</p>\\n<p>Housing will come back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can be sure of that. Over time, the number of housing units necessarily\\nmatches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period of\\nyears prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, we\\nended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy.\\nThat created still another problem for housing: Early in a recession, household formations slow, and in\\n2009 the decrease was dramatic.\\n</p>\\n<p>That devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households\\nthan housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormones\\ntake over. And while \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoubling-up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living with\\nin-laws can quickly lose its allure.\\n</p>\\n<p>At our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 considerably less than the number of new\\nhouseholds being formed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 buyers and renters are sopping up what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left of the old oversupply. (This\\nprocess will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varies\\nwidely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter,\\nemploying only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of the\\neconomy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in a\\ndepression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely\\nlagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Wise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ncreate households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our market\\nsystem will restore the needed balance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 probably before long. When that day comes, we will again\\nbuild one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how far\\nunemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776:\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best days lie ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>Intrinsic Business Value\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic business\\nvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&amp;P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If it\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, we are overpaid at any price.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have no way to pinpoint intrinsic value. But we do have a useful, though considerably understated,\\nproxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however,\\nbook value very roughly tracks business values. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the amount by which Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value\\nexceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, the\\ndivergence will likely become ever more substantial in absolute terms, remaining reasonably steady, however, on\\na percentage basis as both the numerator and denominator of the business-value/book-value equation increase.\\n</p>\\n<p>5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve regularly emphasized that our book-value performance is almost certain to outpace the S&amp;P 500\\nin a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong up-year. The test is how we do\\nover time. Last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual report included a table laying out results for the 42 five-year periods since we took\\nover at Berkshire in 1965 (i.e., 1965-69, 1966-70, etc.). All showed our book value beating the S&amp;P, and our\\nstring held for 2007-11. It will almost certainly snap, though, if the S&amp;P 500 should put together a five-year\\nwinning streak (which it may well be on its way to doing as I write this).\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>I also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you\\nestimate our per-share intrinsic value. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t repeat the full discussion here; you can find it reproduced on\\npages 99-100. To update the tables shown there, our per-share investments in 2011 increased 4% to $98,366, and\\nour pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 18% to $6,990 per share.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I like to see gains in both areas, but our primary focus is on building operating earnings. Over\\ntime, the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings, and we hope also to purchase some\\nlarge operations that will give us a further boost. We now have eight subsidiaries that would each be included in the\\nFortune 500 were they stand-alone companies. That leaves only 492 to go. My task is clear, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the prowl.\\n</p>\\n<p>Share Repurchases\\n</p>\\n<p>Last September, we announced that Berkshire would repurchase its shares at a price of up to 110% of book\\nvalue. We were in the market for only a few days \\xe2\\x80\\x93 buying $67 million of stock \\xe2\\x80\\x93 before the price advanced beyond\\nour limit. Nonetheless, the general importance of share repurchases suggests I should focus for a bit on the subject.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to take\\ncare of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course,\\ninfractions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even serious ones \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In other\\ninstances, a less benign conclusion seems warranted. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suffice to say that repurchases are being made to\\noffset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholders\\nare hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether the\\nmoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. (One\\nCEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I\\nrecommend that you read his annual letter.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We like\\nmaking money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our\\nown stock \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we know to be worth at least x for less than that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for .9x, .8x or even lower. (As one of our\\ndirectors says, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like shooting fish in a barrel, after the barrel has been drained and the fish have quit flopping.)\\nNevertheless, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the selling\\nshareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying,\\ntherefore, we want those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of the assets they are selling.\\n</p>\\n<p>At our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic\\nvalue. And the more and the cheaper we buy, the greater the gain for continuing shareholders. Therefore, if given\\nthe opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know,\\nhowever, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets.\\nNor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strength\\nthat is unquestionable takes precedence over all else.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>This discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors\\nto changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for two\\nevents: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time to\\ncome; and second, we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. A corollary to\\nthis second point: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalking our book\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about a stock we own \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were that to be effective \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would actually be\\nharmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano\\ndid a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Their\\noperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.\\n</p>\\n<p>But their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, a\\nskill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, made\\nvalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.\\n</p>\\n<p>Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%.\\nNaturally, what happens to the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.\\nBeyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for the\\nday: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?\\n</p>\\n<p>I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price to languish throughout the five years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do the math. If IBM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire\\n250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and we\\nwould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year\\nperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after\\nfive years, of which we would own 6.5%.\\n</p>\\n<p>If IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100\\nmillion greater under the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisappointing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher\\nprice. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $11\\xe2\\x81\\x842 billion more than if the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh-price\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nrepurchase scenario had taken place.\\n</p>\\n<p>The logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own\\nmoney or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks\\nrise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including\\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble\\na commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supply.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve observed enough\\nhuman behavior to know the futility of that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And here\\na confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of Ben\\nGraham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock\\nprices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one\\nof the luckiest moments in my life.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the end, the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. But\\nan important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it is\\nlikely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I will\\nabandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet\\nand income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present\\nthem as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. Because we may be repurchasing\\nBerkshire shares from some of you, we will offer our thoughts in each section as to how intrinsic value compares\\nto carrying value.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at insurance, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\\nover the years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Property-casualty (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cP/C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to\\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims\\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.\\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2011 70,571\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely that our float will grow much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if at all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from its current level. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mainly because we\\nalready have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. Were there to be a decline in float, I will add,\\nit would almost certainly be very gradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free\\nmoney \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy\\nresult creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to\\noperate at a significant underwriting loss. For example, State Farm, by far the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest insurer and a well-managed\\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There are\\na lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones.\\n</p>\\n<p>As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine\\nconsecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to\\nunderwrite profitably in most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though certainly not all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be\\nbetter than cost-free. We will profit just as we would if some party deposited $70.6 billion with us, paid us a fee\\nfor holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\\n</p>\\n<p>So how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a\\nliability in calculating Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to\\nreplenish it. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. If\\nfloat is both costless and long-enduring, the true value of this liability is far lower than the accounting liability.\\n</p>\\n<p>Partially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attributable to our insurance\\ncompanies that is included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the\\nfloat-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its\\ntrue value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill asset\\nattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\\ninsurance goodwill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we would pay to purchase float of similar quality \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be far in excess of its historic\\ncarrying value. The value of our float is one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why we believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic\\nbusiness value substantially exceeds book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me emphasize once again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry\\nas a whole: We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there is much \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire-quality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d float existing in the insurance world. In most years,\\nincluding 2011, the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outstanding economics exist only\\nbecause we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about\\nthe major units.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,\\nmost importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to\\nrisks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in that respect than\\nmost large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some\\nmega-catastrophe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a loss about triple anything it has ever faced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a\\nmoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers and\\nreinsurers would be far in the red, and some would face insolvency.\\n</p>\\n<p>From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion and\\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By these\\naccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladly\\ntrade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposure\\nactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,\\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the\\nappropriate premium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn their back on business\\nthat their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other guy is doing it so we must as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spells\\ntrouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.

General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nhuge float has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to\\nbe. In the first few years after we acquired it, General Re was a major headache. Now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a treasure.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 61 years ago.

Our\\ncredit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amply\\ncovers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest\\ncoverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all\\ncircumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and a\\ndiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body.\\n</p>\\n<p>Measured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than\\nany other railroad \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of all inter-city\\nton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as the\\ncirculatory system of our economy. Your railroad is the largest artery.\\n</p>\\n<p>All of this places a huge responsibility on us. We must, without fail, maintain and improve our 23,000\\nmiles of track along with 13,000 bridges, 80 tunnels, 6,900 locomotives and 78,600 freight cars. This job requires\\nus to have ample financial resources under all economic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantly\\nand effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature, such as the widespread flooding BNSF labored under last\\nsummer.\\n</p>\\n<p>To fulfill its societal obligation, BNSF regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge, with the\\nexcess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays.\\nThough many people decry our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be levied\\nagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 funds from the private sector \\xe2\\x80\\x93 into the investment projects\\nneeded to provide better and more extensive service in the future.

The story was far\\ndifferent not many years back when MidAmerican acquired these properties.\\n</p>\\n<p>MidAmerican will have 3,316 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2012, far more\\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that we have invested or committed to\\nwind is a staggering $6 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican retains all of its\\nearnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. In addition, late last year we took on\\ntwo solar projects \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one 100%-owned in California and the other 49%-owned in Arizona \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will cost about $3\\nbillion to construct.

This compilation includes 54 of our companies. But one of these, Marmon, is\\nitself the owner of 140 operations in eleven distinct business sectors. In short, when you look at Berkshire, you\\nare looking across corporate America. So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dig a little deeper to gain a greater insight into what has happened\\nin the last few years.\\n</p>\\n<p>The four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carried\\nunder Finance and Financial Products) had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $227 million in 2009, $362 million in\\n2010 and $359 million in 2011. If you subtract these earnings from those in the combined statement, you will see\\nthat our multiple and diverse non-housing operations earned $1,831 million in 2009, $3,912 million in 2010 and\\n$4,678 million in 2011. About $291 million of the 2011 earnings came from the Lubrizol acquisition. The profile\\nof the remaining 2011 earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $4,387 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 illustrates the comeback of much of America from the\\ndevastation wrought by the 2008 financial panic. Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergency\\nroom, most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Almost all of our managers delivered outstanding performances last year, among them those managers\\nwho run housing-related businesses and were therefore fighting hurricane-force headwinds. Here are a few examples:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Vic Mancinelli again set a record at CTB, our agricultural equipment operation. We purchased CTB in\\n2002 for $139 million. It has subsequently distributed $180 million to Berkshire, last year earned $124\\nmillion pre-tax and has $109 million in cash. Vic has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions over the\\nyears, including a meaningful one he signed up after yearend.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 TTI, our electric components distributor, increased its sales to a record $2.1 billion, up 12.4% from\\n2010. Earnings also hit a record, up 127% from 2007, the year in which we purchased the business. In\\n2011, TTI performed far better than the large publicly-traded companies in its field. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no surprise:\\nPaul Andrews and his associates have been besting them for years. Charlie and I are delighted that Paul\\nnegotiated a large bolt-on acquisition early in 2012. We hope more follow.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Iscar, our 80%-owned cutting-tools operation, continues to amaze us. Its sales growth and overall\\nperformance are unique in its industry. Iscar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny\\nGoldman \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are brilliant strategists and operators. When the economic world was cratering in November\\n2008, they stepped up to buy Tungaloy, a leading Japanese cutting-tool manufacturer. Tungaloy\\nsuffered significant damage when the tsunami hit north of Tokyo last spring. But you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\nthat now: Tungaloy went on to set a sales record in 2011. I visited the Iwaki plant in November and\\nwas inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm of Tungaloy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management, as well as its staff. They are\\na wonderful group and deserve your admiration and thanks.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 McLane, our huge distribution company that is run by Grady Rosier, added important new customers in\\n2011 and set a pre-tax earnings record of $370 million. Since its purchase in 2003 for $1.5 billion, the\\ncompany has had pre-tax earnings of $2.4 billion and also increased its LIFO reserve by $230 million\\nbecause the prices of the retail products it distributes (candy, gum, cigarettes, etc.) have risen. Grady\\nruns a logistical machine second to none. You can look for bolt-ons at McLane, particularly in our new\\nwine-and-spirits distribution business.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

For many of the smaller companies, however, this is not true. I have made more than my share of mistakes\\nbuying small companies. Charlie long ago told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not worth doing at all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not worth\\ndoing well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and I should have listened harder.

So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a\\nbit of GAAP-mandated nonsense I hope both of them enjoy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Common sense would tell you that our varied subsidiaries should be carried on our books at their cost\\nplus the earnings they have retained since our purchase (unless their economic value has materially decreased, in\\nwhich case an appropriate write-down must be taken). And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s essentially the reality at Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 except for\\nthe weird situation at Marmon.\\n</p>\\n<p>We purchased 64% of the company in 2008 and put this interest on our books at our cost, $4.8 billion.\\nSo far, so good. Then, in early 2011, pursuant to our original contract with the Pritzker family, we purchased an\\nadditional 16%, paying $1.5 billion as called for by a formula that reflected Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increased value. In this\\ninstance, however, we were required to immediately write off $614 million of the purchase price retroactive to\\nthe end of 2010. (Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask!) Obviously, this write-off had no connection to economic reality. The excess of\\nMarmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value over its carrying value is widened by this meaningless write-down.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\\n</p>\\n<p>This sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and\\nClayton Homes, the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned\\nsubsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in Berkadia\\nCommercial Mortgage.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instructive to look at what transpired at our three operating businesses after the economy fell off a\\ncliff in late 2008, because their experiences illuminate the fractured recovery that later came along.\\n</p>\\n<p>Results at our two leasing companies mirrored the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-housing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d economy. Their combined pre-tax\\nearnings were $13 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010 and $155 million in 2011, an improvement reflecting the\\nsteady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world of\\nmanufactured housing (just like site-built housing) has endured a veritable depression, experiencing no recovery\\nto date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in\\n2011. (When housing was booming in 2005, they were 146,744.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite these difficult times, Clayton has continued to operate profitably, largely because its mortgage\\nportfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufactured\\nhomes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, you might expect us to suffer\\nheavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaningful down\\npayments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Clayton has kept losses to\\nacceptable levels. It has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time.\\n</p>\\n<p>As is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies,\\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructive\\nbehavior \\xe2\\x80\\x93 government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly was\\nthe almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dips\\nwould be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housing\\ntransactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmonetize\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the increased value of their homes by\\nrefinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemed\\ngreat fun while it lasted.

Its earnings are strong, its\\nassets solid and its capital at record levels. At Bank of America, some huge mistakes were made by prior\\nmanagement.

I have\\nbeen reading the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until a Saturday in March last\\nyear that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not what you look at that matters, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Todd Combs built a $1.75 billion portfolio (at cost) last year, and Ted Weschler will soon create one of\\nsimilar size.

       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>One additional point about these two new arrivals. Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next CEO\\nof Berkshire in making acquisitions. They have excellent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness minds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that grasp the economic forces likely\\nto determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding of\\nwhat is predictable and what is unknowable.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>There is little new to report on our derivatives positions, which we have described in detail in past reports.\\n(Annual reports since 1977 are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com.) One important industry change,\\nhowever, must be noted: Though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements, the rules have\\nchanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shun\\ncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. The possibility of some sudden and huge\\nposting requirement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 arising from an out-of-the-blue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terrorist\\nattack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our insurance-like derivatives contracts, whereby we pay if various issues included in high-yield bond\\nindices default, are coming to a close. The contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired, and the\\nremainder will terminate soon. In 2011, we paid out $86 million on two losses, bringing our total payments to\\n$2.6 billion. We are almost certain to realize a final \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderwriting profit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on this portfolio because the premiums\\nwe received were $3.4 billion, and our future losses are apt to be minor. In addition, we will have averaged about\\n$2 billion of float over the five-year life of these contracts. This successful result during a time of great credit\\nstress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I continue to believe that our equity-put positions will produce a significant profit, considering\\nboth the $4.2 billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the $222 million profit we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already\\nrealized on contracts that we repurchased. At yearend, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value reflected a liability of $8.5 billion for\\nthe remaining contracts; if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been $6.2 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer\\n</p>\\n<p>Investing is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving\\nmore money in the future. At Berkshire we take a more demanding approach, defining investing as the transfer to\\nothers of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after taxes\\nhave been paid on nominal gains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the future. More succinctly, investing is forgoing consumption now in\\norder to have the ability to consume more at a later date.\\n</p>\\n<p>From our definition there flows an important corollary: The riskiness of an investment is not measured\\nby beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the\\nprobability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the reasoned probability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing-power over his\\ncontemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably\\ncertain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a non-fluctuating\\nasset can be laden with risk.\\n</p>\\n<p>Investment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nimportant to understand the characteristics of each. So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey the field.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages,\\nbank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. Their beta may be zero, but their risk is huge.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many\\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This ugly\\nresult, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemic\\nforces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time such\\npolicies spin out of control.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86%\\nin value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buy\\nwhat $1 did at that time. Consequently, a tax-free institution would have needed 4.3% interest annually\\nfrom bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers would\\nhave been kidding themselves if they thought of any portion of that interest as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>For tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year\\nperiod, continuous rolling of U.S. Treasury bills produced 5.7% annually. That sounds satisfactory. But\\nif an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return would\\nhave yielded nothing in the way of real income. This investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visible income tax would have stripped\\nhim of 1.4 points of the stated yield, and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining\\n4.3 points. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s noteworthy that the implicit inflation \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctax\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was more than triple the explicit income tax\\nthat our investor probably thought of as his main burden. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn God We Trust\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be imprinted on our\\ncurrency, but the hand that activates our government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s printing press has been all too human.\\n</p>\\n<p>High interest rates, of course, can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currency-based\\ninvestments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not come\\nclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with a\\nwarning label.\\n</p>\\n<p>Under today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conditions, therefore, I do not like currency-based investments. Even so, Berkshire holds\\nsignificant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ample\\nliquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted, however inadequate rates may be.\\nAccommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can be\\ncounted on for liquidity under the most chaotic of economic conditions. Our working level for liquidity\\nis $20 billion; $10 billion is our absolute minimum.\\n</p>\\n<p>Beyond the requirements that liquidity and regulators impose on us, we will purchase currency-related\\nsecurities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 either because a particular credit is\\nmispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers the\\npossibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nexploited both opportunities in the past \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and may do so again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are now 180 degrees removed from\\nsuch prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seems\\napt: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are\\npurchased in the buyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope that someone else \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who also knows that the assets will be forever\\nunproductive \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of\\nsuch buyers in the 17th century.\\n</p>\\n<p>This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they\\nbelieve the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can\\nproduce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it will remain lifeless forever \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more\\navidly in the future.\\n</p>\\n<p>The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other\\nassets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however,\\nhas two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some\\nindustrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of\\nsoaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still\\nown one ounce at its end.\\n</p>\\n<p>What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the\\npast decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated\\nadditional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.\\nAs \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbandwagon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d investors join any party, they create their own truth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for a while.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses\\nthat can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these\\nbubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d delivered by the market,\\nand the pool of buyers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for a time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles\\nblown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the wise\\nman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Today the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it\\nwould form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At\\n$1,750 per ounce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 gold\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price as I write this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400\\nmillion acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most\\nprofitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would\\nhave about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying\\nbinge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?\\n</p>\\n<p>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual\\nproduction of gold command about $160 billion.

Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its\\nowners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The\\n170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can\\nfondle the cube, but it will not respond.\\n</p>\\n<p>Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely many will still rush to gold. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\nconfident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at\\na rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapse\\ndrives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currency\\ncollapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccash is king\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in late 2008, just\\nwhen cash should have been deployed rather than held. Similarly, we heard \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccash is trash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the early\\n1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On those\\noccasions, investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort.\\n</p>\\n<p>My own preference \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you knew this was coming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is our third category: investment in productive\\nassets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability in\\ninflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a\\nminimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola, IBM\\nand our own See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of our\\nregulated utilities, for example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. To\\nearn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior to\\nnonproductive or currency-based assets.\\n</p>\\n<p>Whether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper\\n(as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Cola\\nor some See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S. population will move more goods, consume more\\nfood, and require more living space than it does now. People will forever exchange what they produce\\nfor what others produce.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens.\\nMetaphorically, these commercial \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccows\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmilk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nto boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity to\\ndeliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows, just as they\\ndid during the 20th century when the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 (and paid loads of dividends as\\nwell). Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses. Our first choice will be\\nto own them in their entirety \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts of\\nmarketable stocks. I believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove to\\nbe the runaway winner among the three we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve examined. More important, it will be by far the safest.\\n</p>\\n<p>19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

That was no surprise to me. After all, the\\nreporters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mantra is: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf your mother says she loves you, check it out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So now I have to back up my claim. At\\nthe meeting, I will take on all comers in making 35-foot tosses of the World-Herald to a Clayton porch. Any\\nchallenger whose paper lands closer to the doorstep than mine will receive a dilly bar. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked Dairy Queen to\\nsupply several for the contest, though I doubt that any will be needed. We will have a large stack of papers. Grab\\none. Fold it (no rubber bands). Take your best shot. Make my day.\\n</p>\\n<p>At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stands) will last until 3:30.

If you decide to leave during the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question periods,\\nplease do so while Charlie is talking.\\n</p>\\n<p>The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot\\nhall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your\\npart, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,249 pairs of Justin boots, 11,254\\npounds of See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s candy, 8,000 Quikut knives (that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15 knives per minute) and 6,126 pairs of Wells Lamont\\ngloves, a Marmon product whose very existence was news to me.

(One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given\\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For\\nat least half of you, I believe we can.\\n</p>\\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new\\nones. I recommend MiTek, an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries.

To obtain the\\nBerkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1st and Monday, May 7th inclusive,\\nand also present your meeting credential. The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several\\nprestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of\\nour shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open\\nfrom10a.m. to9p.m.Monday throughSaturday,and10a.m. to6p.m.onSunday.OnSaturday thisyear, from5:30p.m.\\nto 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from\\n9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 2 p.m., I will be clerking at\\nBorsheims, desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. So come take advantage of me. Ask me for my\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrazy Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x9d price.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30th through Saturday, May 12th. During that period,\\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that\\nshows you are a Berkshire holder.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\\nwill take on all comers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a\\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon\\nOsberg, two of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday\\nafternoon. Two non-experts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Charlie and I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will also be at the tables.\\n</p>\\n<p>Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6th.\\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening at 4 p.m. These\\nrestaurants are my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. (Actuarial tables tell me that I can\\nconsume another 12 million calories before my death. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m terrified at the thought of leaving any of these behind,\\nso will be frontloading on Sunday.) Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st\\n</p>\\n<p>(but not before) and at Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, show some class and order a giant root beer\\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the\\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists\\nand their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com;\\nBecky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times,\\nat arsorkin@nytimes.com.\\n</p>\\n<p>From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the\\nmost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected\\nif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than\\ntwo questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name\\nmentioned if your question is selected.)\\n</p>\\n<p>This year we are adding a second panel of three financial analysts who follow Berkshire. They are Cliff\\nGallant of KBW, Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital and Gary Ransom of Dowling and Partners. These analysts will\\nbring their own Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the market\\nclose on a Friday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts. Our new panel will let\\nanalysts ask questions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps even a few technical ones \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in a manner that may be helpful to many shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>21</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '21': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\\njournalists and analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we like it. All told, we expect at\\nleast 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is\\nsome extra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that\\nwill take place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 13 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly\\nAll-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindset\\nto be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no\\nfinancial need to work; the joy of hitting business \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome runs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means as much to them as their paycheck.\\n</p>\\n<p>Equally important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all\\non one floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).\\n</p>\\n<p>This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements and files a\\n17,839-page Federal income tax return \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hello, Guinness! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as well as state and foreign returns. Additionally,\\nthey respond to countless shareholder and media inquiries, get out the annual report, prepare for the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlargest annual meeting, coordinate the Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the list goes on and on.\\n</p>\\n<p>They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities (selected\\nfrom 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also handle all kinds\\nof requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better.\\n</p>\\n<p>This home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours\\nas well. Come to Omaha \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the cradle of capitalism \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on May 5th and tell them so.\\n</p>\\n<p>February 25, 2012 Warren E.

If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its\\nresults would have lagged the S&amp;P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the\\nS&amp;P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2012, Berkshire achieved a total gain for its shareholders of $24.1 billion. We used $1.3 billion of that\\nto repurchase our stock, which left us with an increase in net worth of $22.8 billion for the year. The per-share book\\nvalue of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 14.4%. Over the last 48 years (that is, since present\\nmanagement took over), book value has grown from $19 to $114,214, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>A number of good things happened at Berkshire last year, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first get the bad news out of the way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 When the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year in\\nwhich we had a gain of $24.1 billion would be subpar, in terms of the comparison we present on the facing\\npage.\\n</p>\\n<p>But subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s percentage increase in book value was less\\nthan the S&amp;P\\xe2\\x80\\x99s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). In\\neight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&amp;P had a gain of 15% or more. We do better when the\\nwind is in our face.\\n</p>\\n<p>To date, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the\\nS&amp;P over such a stretch. (The record is on page 103.) But the S&amp;P has now had gains in each of the last\\nfour years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-\\nyear wins will end.\\n</p>\\n<p>One thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results, my partner Charlie Munger, the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our job to increase intrinsic business\\nvalue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for which we use book value as a significantly understated proxy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at a faster rate than the market\\ngains of the S&amp;P. If we do so, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itself\\noutpace the S&amp;P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, who\\nthemselves can earn S&amp;P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe the gain in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value will over time likely surpass the S&amp;P returns by\\na small margin. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re confident of that because we have some outstanding businesses, a cadre of terrific\\noperating managers and a shareholder-oriented culture. Our relative performance, however, is almost\\ncertain to be better when the market is down or flat. In years when the market is particularly strong, expect\\nus to fall short.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 The second disappointment in 2012 was my inability to make a major acquisition. I pursued a couple of\\nelephants, but came up empty-handed.\\n</p>\\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Our luck, however, changed early this year. In February, we agreed to buy 50% of a holding company that\\nwill own all of H. J. Heinz. The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge Paulo\\nLemann, a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist.\\n</p>\\n<p>We couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinary\\nmanager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holding\\ncompany. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend.

They\\ndelivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpowerhouse five\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had aggregate earnings of $10.1 billion, about $600 million more than in 2011.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of this group, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire eight years\\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,\\nBNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased the\\namount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire\\nby the five companies has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simply\\ngrowing, but rather increasing per-share results.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unless the U.S. economy tanks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our powerhouse five should again deliver higher\\nearnings in 2013. The five outstanding CEOs who run them will see to that.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Though I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We had\\na record year for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbolt-on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded into\\nour existing businesses. These transactions were completed without Berkshire issuing any shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I love these acquisitions: Usually they are low-risk, burden headquarters not at all, and expand\\nthe scope of our proven managers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Our insurance operations shot the lights out last year. While giving Berkshire $73 billion of free money to\\ninvest, they also delivered a $1.6 billion underwriting gain, the tenth consecutive year of profitable\\nunderwriting. This is truly having your cake and eating it too.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO led the way, continuing to gobble up market share without sacrificing underwriting discipline.\\nSince 1995, when we obtained control, GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.5% to\\n9.7%. Premium volume meanwhile increased from $2.8 billion to $16.7 billion. Much more growth lies\\nahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>The credit for GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extraordinary performance goes to Tony Nicely and his 27,000 associates. And to\\nthat cast, we should add our Gecko. Neither rain nor storm nor gloom of night can stop him; the little lizard\\njust soldiers on, telling Americans how they can save big money by going to GEICO.com.\\n</p>\\n<p>When I count my blessings, I count GEICO twice.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

We purchased\\nadditional shares of Wells Fargo (our ownership now is 8.7% versus 7.6% at yearend 2011) and IBM (6.0%\\nversus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage\\nownership.

Over time we\\nexpect substantially greater earnings from these four investees.

At Berkshire, we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant and\\nequipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 19% more than we spent in 2011, our\\nprevious high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are\\nsaying.

Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game that\\nis heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20th\\n</p>\\n<p>Century, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression and\\nmany recessions.

The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.\\n</p>\\n<p>My own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when\\nthe U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headlines told of more\\nsetbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail.\\n</p>\\n<p>The country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per\\ncapita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been\\nuncertain. America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance.\\n</p>\\n<p>If you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries,\\ncall Berkshire. Let us unburden you.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nIn summary, Charlie and I hope to build per-share intrinsic value by (1) improving the earning power of our\\n</p>\\n<p>many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) participating in the growth\\nof our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic\\nvalue; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if\\never, issuing Berkshire shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\\nwill continue to play major roles in the American economy.

As we view\\nthese and other strengths, Charlie and I like your company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospects.\\n</p>\\n<p>Intrinsic Business Value\\n</p>\\n<p>As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\\nis for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the\\nthree elements \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of which was qualitative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 104-105.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to\\n$113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased\\n15.7% to $8,085.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and our\\nper-share earnings figure has grown at a 20.8% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the\\n42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see\\ngains in both areas, but our strong emphasis will always be on building operating earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nNow, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\\n</p>\\n<p>income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them\\nas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at insurance, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\\nover the years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Property-casualty (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cP/C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\\nas those arising from certain workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-\\nnow, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to others.\\nMeanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,\\nthe amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business\\ngrows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2012 73,125\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year I told you that our float was likely to level off or even decline a bit in the future. Our insurance\\nCEOs set out to prove me wrong and did, increasing float last year by $2.5 billion. I now expect a further increase\\nin 2013. But further gains will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float will almost certainly grow. In\\nNational Indemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts\\ndownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the outside no\\nmore than 2% in any year.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay you interest.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest insurer and a\\nwell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Their\\nfinancials for 2012 are not yet available.) There are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry never\\nceases searching for new ones.\\n</p>\\n<p>As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten\\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will\\ncontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. If we do, our float will be better than free money.\\n</p>\\n<p>So how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value is\\ncalculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were\\nunable to replenish it. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving\\nfund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will be, the true value of this liability is\\ndramatically less than the accounting liability.\\n</p>\\n<p>A partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is attributable to our insurance\\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-\\ngenerating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true\\nvalue. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset\\ncarried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Fortunately, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the case at Berkshire.

The value of our float is one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why we believe\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me emphasize once again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\\nwhole: There is very little \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire-quality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d float existing in the insurance world. In 37 of the 45 years ending in\\n2011, the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noverall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by American\\nindustry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.\\n</p>\\n<p>A further unpleasant reality adds to the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegacy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvested\\nduring the next few years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and perhaps for many years beyond that.

Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some\\n</p>\\n<p>extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about the major units.\\n</p>\\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no\\none else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most\\nimportant, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are\\ninappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large\\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit\\nfor the year because it has so many streams of earnings. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhile\\nbe far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\\n</p>\\n<p>From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $35 billion and a\\nsignificant cumulative underwriting profit, a feat that no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. He has\\nthus added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. If you meet Ajit at the annual meeting, bow\\ndeeply.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually\\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both\\nprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate\\npremium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn their back on business\\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nspells trouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge\\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be. We\\nare particularly enthusiastic about General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international life reinsurance business, which has achieved\\nconsistent and profitable growth since we acquired the company in 1998.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 62 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony Nicely,\\n</p>\\n<p>who joined the company at 18 and completed 51 years of service in 2012.\\n</p>\\n<p>I rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record was\\nconsiderably better than is indicated by GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GAAP underwriting profit of $680 million. Because of a change\\nin accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting earnings of\\n$410 million. This item had nothing to do with 2012\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating results, changing neither cash, revenues, expenses\\nnor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value\\nand the value at which we carry it on our books.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss in\\nhistory. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained from\\nKatrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, a\\nstaggering number reflecting GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading market share in the New York metropolitan area.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersistency\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Big dollars ride on those\\ntwo factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than\\n$1 billion. GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prices, they usually\\nfind they can save important sums.

Trucks taking on the same job guzzle about\\nfour times as much fuel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s electric utilities serve regulated retail customers in ten states. Only one utility holding\\ncompany serves more states. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: first, from a standing start nine\\nyears ago, we now account for 6% of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wind generation capacity. Second, when we complete\\nthree projects now under construction, we will own about 14% of U.S. solar-generation capacity.\\n</p>\\n<p>Projects like these require huge capital investments. Upon completion, indeed, our renewables portfolio\\nwill have cost $13 billion. We relish making such commitments if they promise reasonable returns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and on that\\nfront, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\\nmassive investment in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. And it is in our self-interest\\nto conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our managers must think today of what the country will need far down the road. Energy and transportation\\nprojects can take many years to come to fruition; a growing country simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to get behind the curve.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have been doing our part to make sure that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. Whatever you may have heard about our\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rail system has\\nnever been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however, resting on our\\nlaurels: BNSF will spend about $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, roughly double its depreciation charge and more\\nthan any railroad has spent in a single year.\\n</p>\\n<p>10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude some\\npurchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in this\\nmanner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the real expenses and profits of\\nthe businesses aggregated in the table.\\n</p>\\n<p>I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain all of the adjustments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some are small and arcane \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but serious investors should\\nunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.\\nWith software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as\\nthe amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not real\\nexpenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as\\nexpenses when calculating earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though from an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viewpoint they could not be more different.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $600 million for the\\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and indeed\\nthat is the portion we have included in the table above \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the rest not. This difference has become significant\\nbecause of the many acquisitions we have made.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNon-real\\xe2\\x80\\x9d amortization expense also looms large at some of our major investees. IBM has made many\\nsmall acquisitions in recent years and now regularly reports \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadjusted operating earnings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a non-GAAP figure that\\nexcludes certain purchase-accounting adjustments.

       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-real\\xe2\\x80\\x9d amortization charge at Wells Fargo, however, is not highlighted by the company and never, to\\nmy knowledge, has been noted in analyst reports. The earnings that Wells Fargo reports are heavily burdened by an\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9camortization of core deposits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d charge, the implication being that these deposits are disappearing at a fairly rapid\\nclip. Yet core deposits regularly increase. The charge last year was about $1.5 billion.

Some of the\\n</p>\\n<p>businesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25%\\nafter-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poor\\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation.\\n</p>\\n<p>More than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price\\nthan to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimes\\nreverted to my old habit of bargain-hunting, with results ranging from tolerable to terrible. Fortunately, my mistakes\\nhave usually occurred when I made smaller purchases. Our large acquisitions have generally worked out well and,\\nin a few cases, more than well.\\n</p>\\n<p>Viewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ\\n$22.6 billion of net tangible assets and, on that base, earned 16.3% after-tax.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive. We\\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large\\nfigure we show for intangible assets. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have\\ndeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of the businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value\\nby a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and regulated-\\nindustry segments is far greater. It is there that the huge winners reside.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nMarmon provides an example of a clear and substantial gap existing between book value and intrinsic\\n</p>\\n<p>value. Let me explain the odd origin of this differential.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year I told you that we had purchased additional shares in Marmon, raising our ownership to 80% (up\\nfrom the 64% we acquired in 2008). I also told you that GAAP accounting required us to immediately record the\\n2011 purchase on our books at far less than what we paid. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve now had a year to think about this weird accounting\\nrule, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve yet to find an explanation that makes any sense \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nor can Charlie or Marc Hamburg, our CFO, come\\nup with one. My confusion increases when I am told that if we hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already owned 64%, the 16% we purchased\\nin 2011 would have been entered on our books at our cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2012 (and in early 2013, retroactive to yearend 2012) we acquired an additional 10% of Marmon and the\\nsame bizarre accounting treatment was required. The $700 million write-off we immediately incurred had no effect\\non earnings but did reduce book value and, therefore, 2012\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain in net worth.\\n</p>\\n<p>The cost of our recent 10% purchase implies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own.\\nOur balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchase\\nrepresents excellent value. If we are correct, our Marmon holding is worth at least $4.6 billion more than its\\ncarrying value.\\n</p>\\n<p>Marmon is a diverse enterprise, comprised of about 150 companies operating in a wide variety of\\nindustries. Its largest business involves the ownership of tank cars that are leased to a variety of shippers, such as oil\\nand chemical companies. Marmon conducts this business through two subsidiaries, Union Tank Car in the U.S. and\\nProcor in Canada.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Union Tank Car has been around a long time, having been owned by the Standard Oil Trust until that\\nempire was broken up in 1911.

When you spot a UTLX car, puff out your chest a bit and enjoy the\\nsame satisfaction that John D.

Newspapers?\\n</p>\\n<p>During the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may\\npuzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that the\\ncirculation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still\\nholds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements for\\nacquisitions.\\n</p>\\n<p>We can address the second point easily. Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense,\\nwill buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widget\\ncompany. Addressing the first point requires me to provide a more elaborate explanation, including some history.\\n</p>\\n<p>News, to put it simply, is what people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that they want to know. And people will seek their news\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access,\\nreliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of the\\nnews and the person wanting it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Before television and the Internet, newspapers were the primary source for an incredible variety of news, a\\nfact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests were\\ninternational, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latest\\ninformation. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth, even\\nif only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost all\\nof the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cost, and readers rode their coattails.\\n</p>\\n<p>Additionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect\\nproviding even more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnews.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs or\\napartments were available, what supermarkets were carrying which weekend specials, or what movies were showing\\nwhere and when was far more important than the views expressed on the editorial page.\\n</p>\\n<p>16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '16': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they\\nrequired a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmegaphone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to tell the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents why their stores should be visited today. Indeed, big department\\nstores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods they\\nadvertised would fly off the shelves. With no other megaphone remotely comparable to that of the newspaper, ads\\nsold themselves.\\n</p>\\n<p>As long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary;\\nwhether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\nowe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nepotism and monopoly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that\\njoined forces to operate as a single economic unit). This contraction was inevitable because most people wished to\\nread and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulation\\nalmost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads. This symbiotic\\nprocess spelled doom for the weaker paper and became known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurvival of the fattest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Now the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news\\nlong before the presses begin to roll. The Internet offers extensive information about both available jobs and homes.\\nTelevision bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another,\\nnewspapers have therefore lost their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimacy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenues\\nfrom \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelp wanted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d classified ads \\xe2\\x80\\x93 long a huge source of income for newspapers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have plunged more than 90% in\\nthe past 12 years.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Newspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngoing on in your town \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there is no substitute\\nfor a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphs\\nabout Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors will\\nbe read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informational\\nneeds of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. And that process has\\nbeen underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 including Berkshire in Buffalo \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nhave offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen. How could\\nthis lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation,\\nmoreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvirtuous circle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the past\\nreverses.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the\\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette, published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over\\nthe past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. Despite\\nWalter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s powerful example, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, have\\nexplored pay arrangements.

We do not believe that\\nsuccess will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage\\nwill almost certainly lead to skimpy readership.

       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Dividends\\n</p>\\n<p>A number of Berkshire shareholders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 including some of my good friends \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would like Berkshire to pay a\\ncash dividend. It puzzles them that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns,\\nbut pay out nothing ourselves. So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine when dividends do and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense for shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>A profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 projects to\\nbecome more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economic\\nmoat separating the company from its competitors.\\n</p>\\n<p>I ask the managers of our subsidiaries to unendingly focus on moat-widening opportunities, and they find\\nmany that make economic sense. But sometimes our managers misfire. The usual cause of failure is that they start\\nwith the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process is\\nsubconscious; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what makes it so dangerous.\\n</p>\\n<p>Your chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1986 annual report, I described how twenty\\nyears of management effort and capital improvements in our original textile business were an exercise in futility. I\\nwanted the business to succeed and wished my way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought another New\\nEngland textile company.) But wishing makes dreams come true only in Disney movies; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poison in business.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether they\\ncan be intelligently deployed in our various businesses. Our record $12.1 billion of fixed-asset investments and bolt-\\non acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we have\\nan advantage: Because we operate in so many areas of the economy, we enjoy a range of choices far wider than that\\nopen to most corporations. In deciding what to do, we can water the flowers and skip over the weeds.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even after we deploy hefty amounts of capital in our current operations, Berkshire will regularly generate a\\nlot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses.\\nHere our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholders\\nwealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition?\\n</p>\\n<p>I have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is\\nsatisfactory, which means that our shareholders are far wealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for\\nacquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.\\n</p>\\n<p>But, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s particularly\\ntrue at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is now\\nmore difficult than it has been during most of our years.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF is\\na case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the funds\\nrequired for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though large\\ntransactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.\\n</p>\\n<p>The third use of funds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 repurchases \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful\\ndiscount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds\\nintelligently: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to go wrong when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re buying dollar bills for 80\\xc2\\xa2 or less. We explained our criteria for\\nrepurchases in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. We\\noriginally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, we\\nincreased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are\\nmade above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningful\\nway by purchases up to our 120% limit.\\n</p>\\n<p>And that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The\\nnumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends. So\\nbear with me.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. The\\nbusiness earns 12% on tangible net worth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $240,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% on\\nreinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of net\\nworth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>You would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual earnings and\\nhave two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income and\\ncapital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase the\\nfuture earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one-\\nthird payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8%\\neach year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).\\n</p>\\n<p>After ten years our company would have a net worth of $4,317,850 (the original $2 million compounded at\\n8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656\\n(125% of our half of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net worth). And we would live happily ever after \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with dividends and the\\nvalue of our stock continuing to grow at 8% annually.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we\\nwould leave all earnings in the company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be sold\\nat 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would grow\\nannually. Call this option the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell-off\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach.\\n</p>\\n<p>Under this \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell-off\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years\\n($2 million compounded at 12%). Because we would be selling shares each year, our percentage ownership would\\nhave declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the net\\nworth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable to\\neach of us can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the market value of your remaining shares would be $2,804,425, about\\n4% greater than the value of your shares if we had followed the dividend approach.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you\\nwould have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you would have both more cash to spend annually and\\nmore capital value.\\n</p>\\n<p>This calculation, of course, assumes that our hypothetical company can earn an average of 12% annually on\\nnet worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, the\\nS&amp;P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth.\\nBoth assumptions also seem reasonable for Berkshire, though certainly not assured.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the\\nargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history \\xe2\\x80\\x93 admittedly one that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come\\nclose to being repeated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramatically superior to\\nthe dividend policy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Aside from the favorable math, there are two further \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and important \\xe2\\x80\\x93 arguments for a sell-off policy.\\nFirst, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, those\\nwho wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. It\\nis safe to say, however, that a great many of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps even most of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are in a net-savings mode and\\nlogically should prefer no payment at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receipts\\nand capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholders\\nelect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use his\\ndividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also pay\\na 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take place\\nat 125% of book value.)\\n</p>\\n<p>The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually far inferior \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend\\nprogram, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax on\\nonly the gain portion of the cash receipts.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me end this math exercise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by using my\\nown case to illustrate how a shareholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased\\ninvestment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 41\\xe2\\x81\\x844% of my Berkshire\\nshares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) has\\ndecreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentage of the company has significantly decreased.\\n</p>\\n<p>Yet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in\\nBerkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figures\\nare $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have far more money working for me\\nat Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also true that my share of\\nboth Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value and the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005.\\nOver time, I expect this accretion of value to continue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even as I now\\nannually give away more than 41\\xe2\\x81\\x842% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently doubled my\\nlifetime pledges to certain foundations).\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\\n</p>\\n<p>confuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of his\\nCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits, a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition\\nof Security Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a\\nrestaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t switch\\ncapriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.\\n</p>\\n<p>Most companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very\\nreluctantly. Our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Four\\xe2\\x80\\x9d portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certain\\ncases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.\\n</p>\\n<p>We applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and\\nwe love repurchases at appropriate prices.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible\\nand that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policy\\nas long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable.\\nIf the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Annual Meeting\\n</p>\\n<p>The annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 4th at the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova will be in\\ncharge. (Though that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a new name, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same wonderful Carrie as last year; she got married in June to a very\\nlucky guy.) All of our headquarters group pitches in to help her; the whole affair is a homemade production, and I\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be more proud of those who put it together.\\n</p>\\n<p>21</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The target will be the porch of a Clayton Home, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. Last year I\\nsuccessfully fought off all challengers. But now Berkshire has acquired a large number of newspapers and with\\nthem came much tossing talent (or so the throwers claim). Come see whether their talent matches their talk. Better\\nyet, join in. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands).\\n</p>\\n<p>At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie\\nand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question periods, please do so\\nwhile Charlie is talking.\\n</p>\\n<p>The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall\\nthat adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, and\\nmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,090 pairs of Justin boots, (that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pair every\\n30 seconds), 10,010 pounds of See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s candy, 12,879 Quikut knives (24 knives per minute) and 5,784 pairs of Wells\\nLamont gloves, always a hot item. But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy happiness\\nsimply hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shopped at our meeting.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, Brooks, our running shoe company, exhibited for the first time and ran up sales of $150,000.\\nBrooks is on fire: Its volume in 2012 grew 34%, and that was on top of a similar 34% gain in 2011. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmanagement expects another jump of 23% in 2013. We will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at\\nthe meeting.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Sunday at 8 a.m., we will initiate the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire 5K,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for\\nparticipating will be included in the Visitor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guide that you will receive with your credentials for the meeting. We\\nwill have plenty of categories for competition, including one for the media. (It will be fun to report on their\\nperformance.) Regretfully, I will forego running; someone has to man the starting gun.\\n</p>\\n<p>I should warn you that we have a lot of home-grown talent. Ted Weschler has run the marathon in 3:01.\\nJim Weber, Brooks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dynamic CEO, is another speedster with a 3:31 best. Todd Combs specializes in the triathlon,\\nbut has been clocked at 22 minutes in the 5K.\\n</p>\\n<p>That, however, is just the beginning: Our directors are also fleet of foot (that is, some of our directors are).\\nSteve Burke has run an amazing 2:39 Boston marathon. (It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a family thing; his wife, Gretchen, finished the New\\nYork marathon in 3:25.) Charlotte Guyman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best is 3:37, and Sue Decker crossed the tape in New York in 3:36.\\nCharlie did not return his questionnaire.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the\\ncountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).\\nThis special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The\\ndiscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of your\\nexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.\\n</p>\\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new ones.\\nCarol Loomis, who has been invaluable to me in editing this letter since 1977, has recently authored Tap Dancing to\\nWork: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything. She and I have cosigned 500 copies, available exclusively at the\\nmeeting.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Outsiders, by William Thorndike, Jr., is an outstanding book about CEOs who excelled at capital\\nallocation. It has an insightful chapter on our director, Tom Murphy, overall the best business manager I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever\\nmet. I also recommend The Clash of the Cultures by Jack Bogle and Laura Rittenhouse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Investing Between the\\nLines. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Omaha World-Herald will again have a booth, offering a few books it has recently published. Red-\\nblooded Husker fans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is there any Nebraskan who isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will surely want to purchase Unbeatable. It tells the\\nstory of Nebraska football during 1993-97, a golden era in which Tom Osborne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teams went 60-3.\\n</p>\\n<p>22</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices\\nfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus\\nOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21\\xe2\\x81\\x842 hours, and it may be that you can save significant money,\\nparticularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha.

Last year the store did $35.9 million of business during its\\nannual meeting sale, an all-time record that makes other retailers turn green. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you\\nmust make your purchases between Tuesday, April 30th and Monday, May 6th inclusive, and also present your\\nmeeting credential. The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers\\nthat normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made\\nan exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through\\nSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic\\nto which you are all invited.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 3rd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 5th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\\nOn Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in all of\\nDecember, normally a jeweler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best month.\\n</p>\\n<p>Around 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Last year my sales totaled $1.5 million.\\nThis year I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quit until I hit $2 million. Because I need to leave well before sundown, I will be desperate to do\\nbusiness. Come take advantage of me. Ask for my \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrazy Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x9d price.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 29th through Saturday, May 11th. During that period, please\\nidentify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you\\nare a Berkshire holder.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will\\ntake on all comers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkable\\nmagician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.

Both\\nwill be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants are\\nmy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, call\\n402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and at Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, order a giant root beer\\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one. (I once saw Bill Gates polish off two of the giant variety after a\\nfull-course dinner; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when I knew he would make a great director.)\\n</p>\\n<p>We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail\\naddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC,\\nat BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\\n</p>\\n<p>23</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '23': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\\nand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it\\nconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions in\\nany email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your\\nquestion is selected.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year we had a second panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. All were insurance specialists,\\nand shareholders subsequently indicated they wanted a little more variety. Therefore, this year we will have one\\ninsurance analyst, Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb will join the\\nanalyst panel to ask questions that deal with our non-insurance operations.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to spice things up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we would like to add to the panel a credentialed bear on Berkshire, preferably\\none who is short the stock. Not yet having a bear identified, we would like to hear from applicants. The only\\nrequirement is that you be an investment professional and negative on Berkshire. The three analysts will bring their\\nown Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the market\\nclose on a Friday and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional\\ninvestors or analysts. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that will further educate\\nshareholders about their investment.\\n</p>\\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists\\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least 54\\nquestions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is some extra\\ntime, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will take\\nplace at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 11 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\\n</p>\\n<p>Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindset to be\\nas shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no financial\\nneed to work; the joy of hitting business \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome runs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means as much to them as their paycheck.\\n</p>\\n<p>Equally important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on\\none floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).\\n</p>\\n<p>This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 21,500-page\\nFederal income tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries,\\ngets out the annual report, prepares for the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\nthe list goes on and on.\\n</p>\\n<p>They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with 48 universities\\n(selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&amp;A day with me. They also handle all kinds of\\nrequests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do\\nfeel like tap dancing to work every day.\\n</p>\\n<p>This home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as\\nwell.

That gain was after our deducting $1.8 billion\\nof charges \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaningless economically, as I will explain later \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that arose from our purchase of the minority\\ninterests in Marmon and Iscar. After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock\\nincreased by 18.2%. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown\\nfrom $19 to $134,973, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>On the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change in\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share book value versus the market performance of the S&amp;P 500. What counts, of course, is per-\\nshare intrinsic value. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (An\\nextended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108.\\nThose principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders to\\nread them.)\\n</p>\\n<p>As I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve long told you, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference has\\nwidened considerably in recent years. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at 120%\\nof book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value\\nexceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however,\\nbecause the stock price did not descend to the 120% level. If it does, we will be aggressive.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie Munger, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value and\\nintrinsic value will outperform the S&amp;P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fall\\nshort, though, in years when the market is strong \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49\\nyears, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S&amp;P gain exceeded 15%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&amp;P. Through full\\ncycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, you\\ncould always own an index fund and be assured of S&amp;P results.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Year at Berkshire\\n</p>\\n<p>On the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in certain cases very well.\\nLet me count the ways:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 We completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $18 billion to purchase all of NV Energy and a\\nmajor interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.\\n</p>\\n<p>With the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire in\\nfuture acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, Jorge\\nPaulo Lemann. His talented associates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bernardo Hees, Heinz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new CEO, and Alex Behring, its\\nChairman \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are responsible for operations.\\n</p>\\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\\n1/1500th of those shown for A.\\n</p>\\n<p>3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Berkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $8 billion of Heinz preferred stock that\\ncarries a 9% coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual return to\\n12% or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $4.25 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprivate equity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d transaction, there is a crucial\\ndifference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buy\\nmore, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, and\\nwe might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that it\\nwould be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at an\\nequity valuation appropriate to the time).\\n</p>\\n<p>Our partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minor\\nearnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time charges\\nincurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $1.3 billion. Earnings in 2014\\nwill be substantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>With Heinz, Berkshire now owns 81\\xe2\\x81\\x842 companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in the\\nFortune 500. Only 4911\\xe2\\x81\\x842 to go.\\n</p>\\n<p>NV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity\\nto about 88% of Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utility\\noperation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will not be\\nMidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last major acquisition.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 MidAmerican is one of our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPowerhouse Five\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, in\\naggregate, had a record $10.8 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $758 million from 2012. The other\\ncompanies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine years\\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,\\nBNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased the\\nnumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $10.4 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire\\nby the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies\\nour goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-share results.\\n</p>\\n<p>If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to\\nimprove also \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps by $1 billion or so pre-tax.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $4.7 billion pre-tax last year, up from $3.9\\nbillion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that makes 11\\nyears in a row \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong\\nto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has grown from $41 billion to $77 billion.\\nConcurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $22 billion pre-tax, including $3 billion realized in\\n2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>We now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurer\\nBerkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICO\\nin 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recently\\npassed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service. You can\\ndo yourself a favor by calling 1-800-847-7536 or checking Geico.com to see if you, too, can cut your\\ninsurance costs.

They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses\\nand that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and more\\nearnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will be\\nmeaningful.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Last year we invested $3.5 billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in two\\nwonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Marmon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our purchases brought us to the\\n100% ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Iscar \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Wertheimer family\\nelected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the 20% of the business it retained when we bought\\ncontrol in 2006.\\n</p>\\n<p>These purchases added about $300 million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $800\\nmillion of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter\\nrequired that we enter these purchases on our books at $1.8 billion less than we paid, a process that\\nreduced Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value. (The charge was made to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccapital in excess of par value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; figure that one\\nout.)

And, if you\\nthink tenths of a percent aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each\\nincrease of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of their annual\\nearnings by $50 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a\\nwonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better to have a partial interest in the Hope\\ndiamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\\n</p>\\n<p>Going by our yearend holdings, our portion of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Four\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2013 earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. In\\nthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about $1.4 billion last\\nyear. But make no mistake: The $3 billion of their earnings we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report is every bit as valuable to us as\\nthe portion Berkshire records.\\n</p>\\n<p>The earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a move\\nthat enhances our share of future earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turn\\nout to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees will\\ngrow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important,\\nour unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $39 billion at\\nyearend.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Our flexibility in capital allocation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled\\nbusinesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they can\\noperate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe advantage of being bi-sexual is that it\\ndoubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Similarly, our appetite for either operating businesses\\nor passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history. At the time, I called the transaction an \\xe2\\x80\\x9call-in wager on the economic future of the United\\nStates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>That kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too. Charlie and I have always considered\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\\n</p>\\n<p>Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 237 years by betting against America? If you compare our\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. And the dynamism\\nembedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best days lie ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic value by\\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings\\nthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares\\nwhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large\\nacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\\nwill still be playing major roles in our economy. Insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses and\\nindividuals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, we will always maintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $20 billion of cash\\nequivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations. As we view these and other strengths,\\nCharlie and I like your company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Intrinsic Business Value\\n</p>\\n<p>As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out\\nthe three elements \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of them qualitative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased 13.6% to\\n$129,253 and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 12.8% to $9,116\\nper share.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.3% compounded annually, and our\\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43-year\\nperiod has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in\\nboth sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and\\nI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the\\nreporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any ideas!)\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a more\\ndiversified base of earning power.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x94 1967 Annual Report\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at insurance, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled our\\nexpansion since that 1967 report was published.\\n</p>\\n<p>Property-casualty (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cP/C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\\nas those arising from certain workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-\\nnow, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to\\nothers. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come\\nand go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume.\\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2013 77,240\\n</p>\\n<p>Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s float will almost certainly grow.\\nIn National Indemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts\\ndownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the outside no\\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate\\ndemands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurance\\ndiffers in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free\\nmoney \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest insurer and a\\nwell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latest\\nyear for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the\\ninsurance industry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 despite the float income all companies enjoy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will continue its dismal record of earning\\nsubnormal returns as compared to other businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eleven\\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $22 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will\\ncontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers who\\nknow that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.\\n</p>\\n<p>So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value is calculated, the full amount of\\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of\\nfloat as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nsome $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day\\nwrite new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless and\\nlong-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting\\nliability.\\n</p>\\n<p>A counterpart to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is attributable to our insurance\\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid for\\nthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on\\nits true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill\\nasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\\ninsurance goodwill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar\\nquality to that we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a\\nhuge reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why we believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\\ndisciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\\n</p>\\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,\\nmost important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that\\nare inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large\\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-\\ncatastrophe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a\\nsignificant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash,\\nlooking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers and\\nreinsurers would meanwhile be far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\\n</p>\\n<p>From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $37 billion and a large\\ncumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind is an idea\\nfactory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>One venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBHSI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThis initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurance\\nbrokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer can\\nmatch the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising many years in the future\\nwill be paid promptly and fully.\\n</p>\\n<p>BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\\nworld. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with many\\nFortune 500 companies and with smaller operations as well. BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will\\ngenerate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annual\\nmeeting.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure\\nactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after\\nboth prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate\\npremium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn their back on business\\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge\\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We are\\nparticularly enthusiastic about General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistently\\nand profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\\n</p>\\n<p>It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that\\ncaused commentators \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and me as well, briefly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone.\\nGeneral Re is now a gem.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 52 years of service in 2013. Tony became CEO in 1993, and\\nsince then the company has been flying.\\n</p>\\n<p>When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. That operational efficiency continues\\ntoday and is an all-important asset. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The\\ninsurance needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and only a low-cost operation can\\ndeliver these.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after\\nyear. Its low costs create a moat \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an enduring one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that competitors are unable to cross. Meanwhile, our little\\ngecko continues to tell Americans how GEICO can save them important money. With our latest reduction in\\noperating costs, his story has become even more compelling.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In 1995, we purchased the half of GEICO that we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already own, paying $1.4 billion more than the net\\ntangible assets we acquired.

I believe that figure to be approaching $20 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\\nplying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world.

The \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccustomer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pays money now; the insurer promises to\\npay money in the future if certain events occur.\\n</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their\\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even if economic chaos prevails when\\npayment time arrives \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is all-important.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest\\nand most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-\\nlived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccede\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their liabilities\\nto a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one that down the road proved to be financially strapped or\\na bad actor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.\\n</p>\\n<p>Almost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest such\\ntransaction ever recorded, Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising from\\npolicies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materialize\\nin the future.

What is certain,\\nhowever, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $15 billion limit of our policy. No other insurer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npromise would have given Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entity\\nthen handling Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims said it best: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNames [the original insurers at Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] wanted to sleep easy at night,\\nand we think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just bought them the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best mattress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing wide\\nmoats form something unique in the insurance world.

If we do, the amounts involved could be large.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x94 1999 Annual Report\\n</p>\\n<p>We have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristics\\ndistinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and\\nsplit out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\\n</p>\\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceed\\nits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest coverage was 9:1. (Our definition of coverage is\\npre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\\n</p>\\n<p>At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to service its debt under all\\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies\\nexclusively offering an essential service. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earnings\\nstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Now, with the acquisition of\\nNV Energy, MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented by\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of\\ndebt. This advantage benefits both us and our customers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by\\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circulatory system. Its hold on the\\nnumber-one position strengthened in 2013.\\n</p>\\n<p>BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on\\nthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches\\nfurther. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: From a standing start nine years ago, MidAmerican\\nnow accounts for 7% of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wind generation capacity, with more on the way. Our share in\\nsolar \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of which is still in construction \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is even larger.\\n</p>\\n<p>MidAmerican can make these investments because it retains all of its earnings. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little known fact:\\nLast year MidAmerican retained more dollars of earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by far \\xe2\\x80\\x93 than any other American electric\\nutility. We and our regulators see this as an important advantage \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one almost certain to exist five, ten and\\ntwenty years from now.\\n</p>\\n<p>When our current projects are completed, MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s renewables portfolio will have cost $15 billion.\\nWe relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns. And, on that front, we put a large\\namount of trust in future regulation.\\n</p>\\n<p>11</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is meanwhile in our self-\\ninterest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\\n</p>\\n<p>Tangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfaction\\ncovering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities.

       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain all of the adjustments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some are tiny and arcane \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but serious investors should understand\\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. With\\nsoftware, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as the\\namortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not real\\ncosts. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses\\nwhen earnings are calculated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though from an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viewpoint they could not be more different.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $648 million for the\\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the rest not.\\nThis difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. It will almost certainly rise\\nfurther as we acquire more companies.\\n</p>\\n<p>Eventually, of course, the non-real charges disappear when the assets to which they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re related become\\nfully amortized. But this usually takes 15 years and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 alas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it will be my successor whose reported earnings get the\\nbenefit of their expiration.\\n</p>\\n<p>Every dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true at almost all other\\ncompanies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality,\\nhowever, remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>The crowd of companies in this section sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of\\nthese businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing\\nprofits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\\nA few, however, have very poor returns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. I\\nwas not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in\\nwhich it operated.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, my blunders usually involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, however, made my last mistake in purchasing\\neither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\\n</p>\\n<p>Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an\\naverage of $25 billion of net tangible assets during 2013 and, with large quantities of excess cash and little\\nleverage, earned 16.7% after-tax on that capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive.\\nWe have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the\\nlarge figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have\\ndeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying\\nvalue by a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and\\nregulated-industry segments is far greater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, both current\\nand potential competitors read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if they knew our\\nnumbers. So, in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we only\\ndisclose what is required.

(It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted my\\noffer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers or\\nlawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial statements were\\nunaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.\\n</p>\\n<p>Mrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfinancial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $72,264 of net\\nworth and $50 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no zeros omitted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B,\\nher son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.\\n</p>\\n<p>The punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school. Moreover, she emigrated from\\nRussia to America knowing not a word of English. But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs. B\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request, the\\nfamily always sang God Bless America at its gatherings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Aspiring business managers should look hard at the plain, but rare, attributes that produced Mrs. B\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nincredible success.

I will talk more about Ben a bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let me\\nfirst tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though neither changed my net worth by\\nmuch, they are instructive.\\n</p>\\n<p>This tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices,\\ncaused by a widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small rural\\nbanks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of 50% or more that devastated both leveraged farmers and\\ntheir lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aftermath than in our recent\\nGreat Recession.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me\\n$280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothing\\nabout operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many bushels of corn\\nand soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, I\\ncalculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that productivity\\nwould improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.\\n</p>\\n<p>I needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and\\npotentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop and prices would sometimes\\ndisappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under any\\npressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or more\\nwhat I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.\\n</p>\\n<p>17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s landlord when I was the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. was\\nselling. Again, a bubble had popped \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this one involving commercial real estate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the RTC had been created to\\ndispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield from\\nthe property was about 10%. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increase\\nwhen several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who occupied around 20% of the\\nproject\\xe2\\x80\\x99s space \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of this\\nbargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location was also\\nsuperb: NYU wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going anywhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>I joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was an\\nexperienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it they\\ndid. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equity\\ninvestment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several\\nspecial distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve yet to view the property.\\n</p>\\n<p>Income from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in the decades to come. Though\\nthe gains won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and,\\nsubsequently, for my children and grandchildren.\\n</p>\\n<p>I tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, you\\nmust recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple\\nand don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable making a rough\\nestimate of the asset\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every\\ninvestment possibility. But omniscience isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating.\\nThere is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I\\nam skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their first\\ntoss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that\\na given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all\\nabout their daily valuations.

If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stock\\nprices, give it a try on weekdays.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time.\\nIndeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hear\\nTV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nscathing comment: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market\\nmight do in the years immediately following \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1987 and 1994 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was of no importance to me in making\\nthose investments. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever the\\nchatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks\\nprovide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farm\\nor the New York real estate.\\n</p>\\n<p>It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations\\nplaced on their holdings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my\\nproperty yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and those prices\\nvaried widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how in the world could I be other than\\nbenefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I would\\nbuy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\\n</p>\\n<p>Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners\\ncause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest\\nrates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, worse yet,\\nimportant to consider acting upon their comments.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often become\\nfrenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an\\nimplied message of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just sit there, do something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For these investors, liquidity is transformed from the\\nunqualified benefit it should be to a curse.\\n</p>\\n<p>A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflash crash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or some other extreme market fluctuation can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt an investor any more than an erratic\\nand mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if\\nhe has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a\\neuphoric world is your enemy.\\n</p>\\n<p>During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling my\\nfarm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100% of a\\nsolid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. So\\nwhy would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of them\\nmight eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth was\\ngoing to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>When Charlie and I buy stocks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which we think of as small portions of businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our analysis is very\\nsimilar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimate\\nan earnings range for five years out, or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at a\\nreasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimate\\nfuture earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which is usually the case \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have worked\\ntogether, we have never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views\\nof other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccircle of competence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and stay well inside of\\nit. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters that\\noccur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and a\\ndesire to be where the action is.\\n</p>\\n<p>19</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '19': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Most investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise,\\nthey will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.\\n</p>\\n<p>I have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need this skill. In aggregate,\\nAmerican business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in\\nunpredictable fits and starts). In the 20th Century, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497,\\npaying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21st Century will witness further gains, almost certain to be\\nsubstantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 neither he nor his \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelpers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can do\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost\\nS&amp;P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.\\n</p>\\n<p>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of investing for the non-professional. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is also important. The main danger is\\nthat the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become\\ndisillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 observation: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bull market is like sex. It\\nfeels best just before it ends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over a\\nlong period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cknow-nothing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory\\nresults. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-\\nterm results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.\\n</p>\\n<p>If \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of their\\ncrops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earnings\\nrealized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice and\\nswitched properties.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profit\\nfrom giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors in\\naggregate, devoid of benefit. So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in a\\nfarm.\\n</p>\\n<p>My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain\\ninstructions I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbenefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to\\ncertain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee\\ncould not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P\\n500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.) I believe the trust\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term results from this policy will be superior to\\nthose attained by most investors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether pension funds, institutions or individuals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who employ high-fee\\nmanagers.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>And now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbook The Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.\\n</p>\\n<p>Before reading Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, I had wandered around the investing landscape, devouring everything written\\non the subject. Much of what I read fascinated me: I tried my hand at charting and at using market indicia to predict\\nstock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of this\\nwas fun, but I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shake the feeling that I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t getting anywhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>In contrast, Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek\\nletters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and\\n20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.\\n</p>\\n<p>20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>A couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing an\\nunnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the first\\nedition and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 brace yourself \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities of\\nGEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s would have been far different.\\n</p>\\n<p>The 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $17 and earning\\nabout $10 per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leaving\\nhimself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time that\\nrequired the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.\\n</p>\\n<p>The recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlington\\nand Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fully\\nowned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $40 million. Now its\\nsuccessor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earns that amount every four days.\\n</p>\\n<p>I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor. Whatever the cost, it would\\nunderscore the truth of Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Of all the investments I ever\\nmade, buying Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses).\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Local and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensions\\nthey couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that\\nwas born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pension\\nmathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.\\n</p>\\n<p>Investment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to\\nKatharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and the\\nimportance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.\\n</p>\\n<p>During the next decade, you will read a lot of news \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bad news \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about public pension plans.

In this table, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects,\\nthe results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a\\ncorporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500\\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the\\nyears, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>2</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>A note to readers: Fifty years ago, today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management took charge at Berkshire. For this Golden Anniversary,\\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger each wrote his views of what has happened at Berkshire during the past 50\\nyears and what each expects during the next 50. Neither changed a word of his commentary after reading what the\\nother had written. Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts begin on page 24 and Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on page 39. Shareholders, particularly new\\nones, may find it useful to read those letters before reading the report on 2014, which begins below.\\n</p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain in net worth during 2014 was $18.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 8.3%. Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over),\\nper-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>During our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&amp;P 500 to the change in\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share book value. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device\\nfor the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is\\nnow. That was true because Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restated\\nto reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of book\\nvalue were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarked to market.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Today, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these\\nare worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how\\nmuch the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value and its\\nbook value has materially widened.\\n</p>\\n<p>With that in mind, we have added a new set of data \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the historical record of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to\\nthe performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term.\\nMonthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time,\\nhowever, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman\\nand my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share\\nintrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nshares.\\n</p>\\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500th of\\nthose shown for A.\\n</p>\\n<p>3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The Year at Berkshire\\n</p>\\n<p>It was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPowerhouse Five\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a collection of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest non-insurance businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 had a record $12.4\\nbillion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group are\\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve called it Iscar in the past),\\nLubrizol and Marmon.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago.\\nSubsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, we\\npaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the\\nnumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire by\\nthe five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our\\ngoal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\\n</p>\\n<p>If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve\\nas well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that have\\nalready closed or are under contract.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During the\\nyear, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures can\\nbadly hurt their businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>BNSF is, by far, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we\\nwill spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroad\\nhas spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings or\\ndepreciation charges.\\n</p>\\n<p>Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating\\nproblems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts\\noperations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show\\nresults. During the last three months, BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance metrics have materially improved from last\\nyear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in\\n2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have two\\ncompanies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250\\nmillion and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection of\\nbusinesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\nmakes 12 years in a row \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money that\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has grown from $41 billion to $84\\nbillion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings, float\\ngenerates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.\\n</p>\\n<p>* Throughout this letter, as well as in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGolden Anniversary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letters included later in this report, all earnings are\\nstated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billion\\nearned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on\\nacquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8\\nbillion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, the\\nlargest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed under\\nMarmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jurisdiction.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.) They deploy\\ncapital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert\\nmanagers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularly\\nappealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in the\\nacquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnership\\nwould work well from both a personal and financial standpoint. And it most definitely has.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not embarrassed to admit that Heinz is run far better under Alex Behring, Chairman, and Bernardo\\nHees, CEO, than would be the case if I were in charge. They hold themselves to extraordinarily high\\nperformance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.\\n</p>\\n<p>We expect to partner with 3G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financing\\nrole, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement,\\nhowever, will usually be to link up as a permanent equity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the\\nfinancing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or with\\nother partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will be\\nlimited to friendly transactions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that is\\nexceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decided\\nthat if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recently\\ncompleted, and we are now \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccar guys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Larry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partners\\nof all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl is\\nnow the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that are\\noutstanding.\\n</p>\\n<p>In recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. There\\nare about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by the\\nrelevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers to\\nwelcome further purchases by us. If we do this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will\\nbuild a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $9 billion of sales.\\n</p>\\n<p>With the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 91\\xe2\\x81\\x842 companies that would be listed on the Fortune\\n500 were they independent (Heinz is the 1\\xe2\\x81\\x842).

We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our\\nownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, American\\nExpress and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from\\n9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership of\\nWells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t important, ponder this\\nmath: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raises\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a\\nwonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business.

In\\nthe earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about $1.6 billion last\\nyear. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.)

Their retained\\nearnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to\\nexpect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time\\n(though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gains\\nmaterialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital\\ngains.

I therefore think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our two\\ninvestment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity for\\nthem to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, though\\nsmaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn\\n$100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the very\\nlimited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of work\\nand, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to say\\namong the best).\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history.

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett\\nPartnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\\n</p>\\n<p>Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting against America? If you compare our\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real\\nper-capita U.S. output has sextupled. My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see.\\nThough the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen one who wishes to\\nemigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).\\n</p>\\n<p>The dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come in a\\nsmooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, most\\nassuredly, America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best days lie ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share intrinsic value by\\n(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings\\nthrough bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares\\nwhen they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large\\nacquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway\\nEnergy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of most\\nfamilies. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and I\\nsee a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.\\n</p>\\n<p>Intrinsic Business Value\\n</p>\\n<p>As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that\\nnumber is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the\\nthree elements \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of them qualitative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic\\nvalue. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to\\n$140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 per\\nshare.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and our\\nearnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44\\nyears has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both\\nsectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66\\nand Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquire\\nDuracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and\\nI view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to\\nprovide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the\\nreporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any ideas!)\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at insurance, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has\\npropelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &amp;\\nMarine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution was\\nsimplicity itself.\\n</p>\\n<p>Jack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to my\\noffice saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s companies had ever had an\\naudit by a public accounting firm, and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also a\\nbit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.\\n</p>\\n<p>On pages 128-129, we reproduce the 11\\xe2\\x81\\x842-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction.\\nThat contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best deal: National\\nIndemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds that\\nof any other insurer in the world.\\n</p>\\n<p>One reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C\\ninsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain\\nworkers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model\\nleaves P/C companies holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,\\ninsurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of\\nfloat an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business\\ngrows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2014 83,921\\n</p>\\n<p>Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercial\\ninsurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division, however, is\\nparty to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it\\nwill be very gradual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that\\nwe can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strength\\nis a key pillar in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic fortress.\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\\nvigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the\\ninsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning\\nsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low\\ninterest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profit\\nproblems of the industry.\\n</p>\\n<p>As noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for\\ntwelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we\\nwill continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers,\\nwho know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message is\\ngiven at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.\\n</p>\\n<p>So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value is calculated, the full amount\\nof our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think\\nof float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims\\nand related expenses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that reduces float. Just\\nas surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the\\ndoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.\\n</p>\\n<p>A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asset that we incurred in buying\\nour insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid\\nfor the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing\\non its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any\\ngoodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\\ninsurance goodwill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\\noperation possessing it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with\\nwhich we agree) this excess value will never be entered on our books. But I can assure you that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one\\nreason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why we believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\\n</p>\\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,\\nmost important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that\\nare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a loss about triple anything\\nit has ever experienced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its\\nmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a market\\nthat might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if not\\nfacing insolvency.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ajit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking\\nfor more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of Berkshire\\nHathaway Specialty Insurance (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBHSI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly\\nwelcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we had\\nwritten only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance\\nworld. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines of\\ninsurance. We repeat last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generate\\nvolume in the billions within a few years.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually\\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both\\nprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate\\npremium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn their back on business\\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nspells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge\\nfloat has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue.\\nWe are particularly enthusiastic about General Re\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international life reinsurance business, which has grown\\nconsistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\\n</p>\\n<p>It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused\\ncommentators \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and me as well, briefly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re\\nis now a gem.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony\\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, and\\nsince then the company has been flying. There is no better manager than Tony.\\n</p>\\n<p>When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the\\ncompany enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO\\nwould succeed because it deserved to succeed. No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes\\nto drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\nonly a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by\\ninsuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.\\n</p>\\n<p>10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

The \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccustomer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pays money now; the insurer promises to\\npay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.\\n</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their\\n20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails when\\npayment time arrives, is all-important.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest and\\nmost sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities.\\nThat is, these insurers wished to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccede\\xe2\\x80\\x9d these liabilities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of them potential losses from asbestos claims \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to a\\nreinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hook\\nfor it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatens\\nthe original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billion\\nsingle premium. I believe that the policy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, in\\nwhich the premium was $7.1 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>In fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And,\\nyes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50\\nyears or more from now. When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this type\\nwill be made, Berkshire has been the party \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the only party \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to call.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by\\nwide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world.

       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\\n</p>\\n<p>We have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBHE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), that share important\\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in\\nthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\\n</p>\\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceed\\nits interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition of\\ncoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\\n</p>\\n<p>At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.\\nThe first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an\\nessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earnings\\nstreams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have further\\nbroadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of AltaLink, an electric transmission system\\nserving 85% of Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage of\\nbeing owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt.\\nThis economic fact benefits both us and our customers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by\\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\\nestablishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circulatory system.\\n</p>\\n<p>BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally\\nfriendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on\\nthe same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 BHE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. In\\naddition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% of\\nthe country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses,\\nBHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural gas consumption; the recently-\\npurchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. and\\nPhilippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout the\\nworld for decades to come.\\n</p>\\n<p>BHE can make these investments because it retains all of its earnings. In fact, last year the company\\nretained more dollars of earnings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by far \\xe2\\x80\\x93 than any other American electric utility. We and our\\nregulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one almost certain to distinguish\\nBHE from other utilities for many years to come.\\n</p>\\n<p>When BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s renewables portfolio\\nwill have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions.\\nWe relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, on that front, we put a large\\namount of trust in future regulation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\\nneed massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our\\nself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they\\nrepresent.\\n</p>\\n<p>12</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

In contrast, the operating expense\\nfigures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain\\nintangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more\\naccurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP\\nfigures.\\n</p>\\n<p>I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain all of the adjustments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some are tiny and arcane \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but serious investors should understand\\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For\\nsoftware, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges against\\nother intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accounting\\nrules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.\\nBoth, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though from an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viewpoint\\nthey could not be more different.\\n</p>\\n<p>14</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been\\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the rest not. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-real\\xe2\\x80\\x9d charges, once non-\\nexistent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real\\namortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\\n</p>\\n<p>The GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have\\n$7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course,\\nevery dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even if\\ntrue earnings are flat.\\n</p>\\n<p>Depreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report\\nis a real cost. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wire\\nthem up for a polygraph test.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>To get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging from\\nlollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets,\\nenjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good\\nreturns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes I\\nmade in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic\\ndynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally\\nworked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasing\\neither businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\\n</p>\\n<p>Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\\nof $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and using\\nlittle leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. We\\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large\\nfigure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in\\nthis sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a good\\nmargin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in\\nboth the insurance and regulated-industry segments is far greater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually.

       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\\n</p>\\n<p>This year we include in this section Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars,\\ncontainers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? At\\none time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gain\\nmore insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leasing operations under this heading. (The figures\\nfor the many dozens of Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other businesses remain in the previous section.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Our other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers).\\nThese companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has\\ngained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors,\\nand that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paying off.\\n</p>\\n<p>Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest home\\nbuilder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought by\\nAmericans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Key to Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings is the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of\\n2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbacking. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 retail sales as well as our own.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many of Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of our\\nborrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than their\\nhigher-income brethren.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. The\\nnature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improved\\npricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleet\\nconsists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.\\n</p>\\n<p>One further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we\\nmanufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book any profit when we transfer\\ncars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division.

Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and the\\nmarket value was a similar amount.\\n</p>\\n<p>17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a\\nprofit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthumb-sucking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)\\n</p>\\n<p>During 2014, Tesco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems worsened by the month. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market share fell, its margins\\ncontracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a\\ncockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.\\n</p>\\n<p>We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we should\\nmention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444\\nmillion, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investment\\nloss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these losses\\noccurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed to\\nbe even cheaper.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Our investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&amp;P 500\\nrose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2.\\nConcurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes\\n$1 to buy what could be bought for 13\\xc2\\xa2 in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).\\n</p>\\n<p>There is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars.\\nThink back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe transfer to others of purchasing power\\nnow with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after taxes have been paid on nominal\\ngains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far\\nsafer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Treasuries, for\\nexample \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, a\\nperiod including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree or\\nanother it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.\\n</p>\\n<p>Stock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term, however,\\ncurrency-denominated instruments are riskier investments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 far riskier investments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 than widely-diversified stock\\nportfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. That\\nlesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy for\\nrisk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from\\nsynonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.\\n</p>\\n<p>It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and\\npurchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 say,\\ninvestment banks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell\\nsecurities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for funds\\nshould keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.\\n</p>\\n<p>For the great majority of investors, however, who can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and should \\xe2\\x80\\x93 invest with a multi-decade horizon,\\nquotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing\\npower over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less\\nrisky than dollar-based securities.\\n</p>\\n<p>18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '18': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may,\\nironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned falling\\nstock prices and advised investing in \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded this\\nsermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (The\\nS&amp;P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, these\\ninvestors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fund\\nwhose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups and\\ndowns, to be sure).\\n</p>\\n<p>Investors, of course, can, by their own behavior, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active\\ntrading, attempts to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctime\\xe2\\x80\\x9d market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary fees\\nto managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner of\\nequities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has no place in the investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tool kit: Anything can\\nhappen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and definitely not Charlie nor I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can\\ntell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.\\n</p>\\n<p>The commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe little guy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Huge institutional\\ninvestors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sits\\ntight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn,\\nrecommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though in the short run, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult\\nto determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high\\nfees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to\\ntheir siren songs, investors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 large and small \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should instead read Jack Bogle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Little Book of Common Sense\\nInvesting.\\n</p>\\n<p>Decades ago, Ben Graham pinpointed the blame for investment failure, using a quote from Shakespeare:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The Annual Meeting\\n</p>\\n<p>The annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 2nd at the CenturyLink Center.

I had expected the letter; I was\\nsurprised by the price.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership\\nLtd. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBPL\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before the\\ntender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and he\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFine, we have a deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then came Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbehavior and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tender.\\n</p>\\n<p>That was a monumentally stupid decision.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it\\noperated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unable\\nto change course.\\n</p>\\n<p>That was true even though the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own\\nBoard minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe textile industry in New England started going out of\\nbusiness forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply and\\ndemand have been balanced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>About a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nboth with roots in the 19th Century \\xe2\\x80\\x93 joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and\\n10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements\\nviewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the\\nconsolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase\\nshares. And that pattern caught my attention.\\n</p>\\n<p>I purchased BPL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more\\nrepurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and\\nbook value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff\\nremaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure\\nwas enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set\\nout to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of our\\noriginal purchases. There it was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for other\\ndiscarded butts.\\n</p>\\n<p>Instead, irritated by Stanton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire\\nshares.\\n</p>\\n<p>24</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '24': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>By April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board\\nmeeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and my childish behavior \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after all, what\\nwas an eighth of a point to either of us? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital\\ninvested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.\\n</p>\\n<p>Because of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had\\nfallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by the\\ntextile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1964 annual report\\nis reproduced on pages 130-142.)\\n</p>\\n<p>For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions.

During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the\\ntextile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness \\xe2\\x80\\x93 stupidity? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has its limits.

Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the most\\ncostly in my career.\\n</p>\\n<p>Early in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNICO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a small but\\npromising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweet\\nspot: I understood and liked the industry.\\n</p>\\n<p>Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 me, personally. In\\nno way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nhad 48 years to think about that question, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossal\\nmistake.\\n</p>\\n<p>If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to\\nform the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impeded\\nfor nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequent\\nacquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by the\\nlegacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I opted\\nto marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decision\\nthat eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>One more confession and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought\\nWaumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbargain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d based on the\\nassets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing textile business. Nevertheless \\xe2\\x80\\x93 surprise,\\nsurprise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.\\n</p>\\n<p>And now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct.

Indeed, the many dozens of\\nfree puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute\\ninvestment performance.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a\\n1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learned\\nthat GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gains\\nin those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben\\nGraham had taught me that technique, and it worked.\\n</p>\\n<p>But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only\\nto a point. With large sums, it would never work well.\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term\\ninvestments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriage\\npartner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating.

Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, long\\nafter he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor who\\nintroduced us predicted that we would hit it off \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we did.\\n</p>\\n<p>If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious\\nmemory, and some firm opinions. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree. In 56 years,\\nhowever, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWarren,\\nthink it over and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll agree with me because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re smart and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>What most of you do not know about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began\\nhis career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30s\\nby designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that he\\nlives in today \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recent\\nyears, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91,\\nis working on another major project.\\n</p>\\n<p>From my perspective, though, Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most important architectural feat was the design of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nBerkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful\\nprices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.\\n</p>\\n<p>26</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his\\nlogic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blueprint. My role has been that of general\\ncontractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.\\n</p>\\n<p>The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nremember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps,\\na company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning\\nabout $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a huge\\nasset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significant\\npricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, these\\nwould materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s could be expected to\\ngush cash for decades to come.\\n</p>\\n<p>The family controlling See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that\\nmuch. But I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A price\\nthat was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific\\npurchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.\\n</p>\\n<p>To date, See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only\\n$40 million. See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that,\\nin turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, through\\nwatching See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes to\\nmany other profitable investments.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Even with Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was\\nDexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like a\\ncigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simply\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that coming.\\n</p>\\n<p>Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP\\naccounting, however, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshire\\nstock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7\\nbillion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.\\n</p>\\n<p>Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose\\nearnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderful\\nbusiness \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which Berkshire most certainly is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares\\nBerkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director).

And they richly\\ndeserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why the\\nconglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the\\nsilliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality,\\npromotion or dubious accounting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and often by all three \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock\\nto, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-so\\ntimes earnings. They immediately applied \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpooling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d accounting to the acquisition, which \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with not a dime\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth\\nof change in the underlying businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof of\\nmanagerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even the\\nenhancement, of the acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure and\\nthereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Wall Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denizens are\\nalways ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings,\\nparticularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willingly\\nsprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how to\\nfurther juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, its\\nCEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristically\\nmediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncollection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was deal\\nvelocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>The resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, Litton\\nIndustries, Gulf &amp; Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famous\\nconglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery Napoleon meets his Watergate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>Back then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many of them ridiculously transparent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were excused or\\noverlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a huge\\nplus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how\\nbad the operating realities of the business might become.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbold, imaginative\\naccounting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found a\\nmanager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.\\n</p>\\n<p>29</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '29': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Eventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, it\\nbecame evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just like chain-letter\\nmodels \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodically\\nblossom in our country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they are every promoter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise.\\nThe ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters,\\nthe sums hijacked can be staggering.\\n</p>\\n<p>At both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That\\nbehavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that is\\noverpriced and \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all too often \\xe2\\x80\\x93 outright dishonesty.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>So what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conglomerate structure? To put the case\\nsimply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capital\\ngrowth.\\n</p>\\n<p>One of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets\\nwill direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all its\\nexcesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire\\nminutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed for\\ndecades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning our\\nobsolete textile mills for far too long.\\n</p>\\n<p>A CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital into\\nunrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes be\\nadmitted. Moreover, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely that CEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job\\neven if he or she was inclined to undertake it.\\n</p>\\n<p>At the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attempt\\nto reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as they\\nmove capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes then\\nclamor to be fed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocators\\nas leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come cheap.\\n</p>\\n<p>In contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at\\nminimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will make\\nmore. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, we can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 move huge sums from\\nbusinesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise.\\nMoreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to\\npressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important: If horses had\\ncontrolled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\\n</p>\\n<p>30</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '30': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Another major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a.k.a. common\\nstocks. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative has\\nproved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offered\\nby the stock market every day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in small pieces, to be sure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are often far more attractive than the businesses we are\\nconcurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve realized from marketable securities have\\nhelped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.\\n</p>\\n<p>In effect, the world is Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oyster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those\\nrealistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we can\\nevaluate. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like ten\\nyears from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has been\\nconfined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a far larger size than the many businesses\\nthat are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.\\n</p>\\n<p>I mentioned earlier that See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital\\nrequirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. But\\nour many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we have\\nused the excess funds generated by See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to help purchase other businesses. If See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s had remained a stand-alone\\ncompany, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavily\\ndepleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now the\\nhome of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>Families that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, the\\nbest decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understands\\nwell. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)\\n</p>\\n<p>When one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makes\\nsense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.\\n</p>\\n<p>The first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing \\xe2\\x80\\x9csynergies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the\\ncombining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nassociates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and there are\\nplenty of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe got\\nthe goldmine, I got the shaft.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately called\\nthemselves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleveraged buyout firms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remember RJR and\\nBarbarians at the Gate? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these buyers hastily relabeled themselves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprivate-equity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reduced and debt is piled on in\\nvirtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in part\\ndetermined by the buyer assessing the maximum amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.\\n</p>\\n<p>31</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '31': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage\\nwith new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharply\\ndownward, sometimes even to a negative figure.\\n</p>\\n<p>In truth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt\\nis currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often to\\nanother leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyond\\nthat, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealing\\nwith banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some sellers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of\\ncompetition.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Sometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no\\nsense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability to\\nmove funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicate\\nthemselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominal\\ncosts for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directors\\nwould soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. For\\nexample, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate huge\\namounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantage\\nover most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.\\n</p>\\n<p>Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50%\\npremiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontrol value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO takes charge. (What\\nacquisition-hungry manager will challenge that assertion?)\\n</p>\\n<p>A few years later, bankers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bearing straight faces \\xe2\\x80\\x93 again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the\\nearlier acquisition in order to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunlock shareholder value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of its\\npurported \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontrol value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company will\\nflourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy\\nof the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)\\n</p>\\n<p>If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be\\nurged by its bankers to pay a hefty \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontrol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d premium for the privilege. (Mental \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflexibility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of this sort by the\\nbanking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading to\\nfees.)\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators.\\nBerkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divest\\na bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.\\n</p>\\n<p>32</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '32': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation\\nflexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now would\\nhave difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantages\\nderived from Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likely\\nincur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned\\nearlier: LTV. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about Jimmy\\nLing that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.\\n</p>\\n<p>Through a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to\\nnumber 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerial\\nskills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had no\\npeer in that respect.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy, which he labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproject redeployment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was to buy a large company and then partially\\nspin off its various divisions. In LTV\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost\\nimportantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The press, the public and Wall\\nStreet loved this sort of talk.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1967 Ling bought Wilson &amp; Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and\\npharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson &amp; Co. (meatpacking), Wilson Sporting\\nGoods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly became\\nknown on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.\\n</p>\\n<p>Soon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s,\\nLing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.\\n</p>\\n<p>Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can count on that. More Jimmy\\nLings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers will\\nfight for their business. What they are saying will recently have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworked.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Their early followers will be feeling very\\nclever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4.

       "  '33': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The Next 50 Years at Berkshire\\n</p>\\n<p>Now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what\\nwas coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what I\\nwould say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshire\\nshareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because our per-share\\nintrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.\\n</p>\\n<p>This cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entry point into\\nBerkshire stock is unusually high \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shares\\nhave occasionally reached \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In other\\nwords, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshire\\nis not exempt from this truth.\\n</p>\\n<p>Purchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company\\nwould repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndirectors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our\\nview, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)\\n</p>\\n<p>For those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer no assurances,\\nwhatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods will\\nlikely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic value\\nof your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the short-term the market is a voting\\nmachine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\namateurs and professionals alike \\xe2\\x80\\x93 border on lunacy.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire\\nshares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should look\\nelsewhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three\\ntimes since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close to\\nthis kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be a\\nsatisfactory holding for investors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing\\nleverage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero.\\nWe will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jackets\\nto the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst responder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during the 2008-2009\\nmeltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earnings\\npotential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.\\n</p>\\n<p>Financial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under all circumstances: (1) a large\\nand reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) no significant near-term cash\\nrequirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpected\\nproblems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturing\\nobligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindset\\ncan be.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how we will always stand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes from\\na vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitive\\nadvantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncontinued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previously\\nexperienced.\\n</p>\\n<p>34</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '34': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Next up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as an\\nunproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business as\\noxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.\\n</p>\\n<p>American business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperous\\ncompanies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, their\\nfinancial oxygen disappeared.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbreathing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late September\\nand early October, we supplied $15.6 billion of fresh money to American businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>We could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and usually far more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in cash\\nequivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed to\\ndeliver liquidity and actually do so, except when it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legal\\ntender. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave home without it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally \\xe2\\x80\\x93 getting to our third point \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can\\nresult in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debt\\nmaturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require large\\ncollateral calls.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly\\nmispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable.\\nRecently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that ended\\nour interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for some\\nyears, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option.\\nMany life insurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crun\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in times of\\nextreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. If\\nour premium volume should shrink, our float would decline \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but only at a very slow pace.\\n</p>\\n<p>The reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely\\npredictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Though\\npractically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is always uncertain. (I felt no special apprehension\\non December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t predict what tomorrow will bring, you\\nmust be prepared for whatever it does.\\n</p>\\n<p>A CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have\\nonly a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 99% of the time. Those odds,\\nhowever, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nentrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it is\\nmadness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning\\npower of Berkshire. That does not mean operating earnings will increase each year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 far from it. The U.S.\\neconomy will ebb and flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though mostly flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. But\\nwe will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe,\\ntherefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.\\n</p>\\n<p>In some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition,\\nand chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep moving\\nforward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we will\\npurchase. In most years, moreover, our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business.

At\\nBerkshire, directors walk in your shoes.\\n</p>\\n<p>To further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non-\\nexecutive Chairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should ever\\nbe employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that this\\nproblem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 likely as low as at any public company. In my\\nservice on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre\\nCEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)\\n</p>\\n<p>If elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all\\ndirectors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about the\\nCEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors be\\napprehensive, Howard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire board\\nmeetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection and\\nretention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires the\\nreplacement of a subsidiary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO to be a\\nrational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights into\\nhuman behavior. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m no\\ngenius, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n</p>\\n<p>Character is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be \\xe2\\x80\\x9call in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the company, not for himself. (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using male\\npronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help\\nbut earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that neither ego nor avarice\\nmotivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements far\\nexceed theirs. A CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear to them that\\nshareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way of\\nthinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>36</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the\\nstrongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintain\\nfriendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.\\n</p>\\n<p>In their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Their\\nstrengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them to\\nfall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-time\\nfinancial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.\\n</p>\\n<p>Only a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger.\\nHe must never forget Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plea: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to die, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never go there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If our non-\\neconomic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic value would collapse as well. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTone at the\\ntop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be key to maintaining Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special culture.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinary\\ndelegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense,\\nBerkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we have\\nnever had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many use\\nthem as an important internal tool). We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a legal office nor departments that other companies take\\nfor granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.\\n</p>\\n<p>We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a damned fool. To an unusual degree,\\nhowever, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, they\\nwere doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore,\\nour trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews and\\nlayers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what we\\nwould wish for, if the positions were reversed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire\\nboard has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively\\nyoung, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well\\nover ten years at the helm. (It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65\\neither (or have you noticed?).\\n</p>\\n<p>In both Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our\\ncounterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO. Developing confidence of\\nthat sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a successor ready to\\nassume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better\\njob than I am doing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists.\\nThey will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to be\\ncoordinated with Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investment\\nmanagers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. Todd\\nCombs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment team, are first-\\nrate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.\\n</p>\\n<p>All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right\\npeople in place \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture,\\nfurthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both\\ngood and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and\\noperating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind\\nand permanent home.\\n</p>\\n<p>37</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Those insurers as a group\\nwould be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producing\\nsubstantial \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.\\n</p>\\n<p>(5) There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system,\\nretirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.\\n</p>\\n<p>(6) Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.\\n</p>\\n<p>(i) He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncasualty insurers.\\n</p>\\n<p>(ii) He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation and\\nobtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.\\n</p>\\n<p>(iii) He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive\\nadvantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.\\n</p>\\n<p>(iv) He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nCEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.\\n</p>\\n<p>(v) He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as he\\nwould wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours of\\nanswering questions at annual shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meetings.\\n</p>\\n<p>(vi) He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders,\\nand other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.\\n</p>\\n<p>(vii) His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularly\\nthat which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and\\n</p>\\n<p>39</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for a\\nlong time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.\\n</p>\\n<p>(10) In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love for\\nthe business and circumstances the CEO was in.\\n</p>\\n<p>(11) As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.\\n</p>\\n<p>(12) Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.\\n</p>\\n<p>(13) Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.\\n</p>\\n<p>(14) Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthiness\\nunder all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusual\\nopportunities.\\n</p>\\n<p>(15) Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such a\\nbusiness would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire would\\never know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I\\nknow of has half of such elements in place.\\n</p>\\n<p>How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?\\n</p>\\n<p>Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares and was completely trusted\\nby all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshire\\nsystem.\\n</p>\\n<p>Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nachievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsubsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while using\\ndifferent systems.\\n</p>\\n<p>What was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?\\n</p>\\n<p>Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:\\n</p>\\n<p>(1) He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most\\nimportant people in the system, starting with himself.\\n</p>\\n<p>(2) He wanted win/win results everywhere--in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance.\\n(3) He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually\\n</p>\\n<p>stayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.\\n(4) He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at\\n</p>\\n<p>headquarters.\\n(5) He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained.\\n</p>\\n<p>When Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into\\nsome benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.\\n</p>\\n<p>40</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '40': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?\\n</p>\\n<p>Only four large factors occur to me:\\n</p>\\n<p>(1) The constructive peculiarities of Buffett,\\n(2) The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,\\n(3) Good luck, and\\n(4) The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the\\n</p>\\n<p>press.\\n</p>\\n<p>I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive\\npeculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.\\n</p>\\n<p>In particular, Buffett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to\\nkeep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became good\\nat tennis.\\n</p>\\n<p>Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most\\nregularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponents\\nalways faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improved\\nmore than was normal.\\n</p>\\n<p>And Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person,\\nnot seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deteriorating\\nlike the skill of a basketball player does.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries,\\nBuffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs and\\nthe achievements of the subsidiaries.\\n</p>\\n<p>Then, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and\\nBerkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries into\\nBerkshire, and better CEOs as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>And the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cvirtuous circle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>How well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?\\n</p>\\n<p>Marvelously well. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.\\n</p>\\n<p>Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equity, as\\ndid Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&amp;P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during the\\nlast 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.\\n</p>\\n<p>And, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance subsidiaries greatly\\noutperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance\\n(perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurance\\nbusiness that produced both a huge \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire,\\nfollowed by a quadrupling of GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market share. And the rest of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance operations hugely\\nimproved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches,\\nand recruiting and holding outstanding people.\\n</p>\\n<p>41</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '41': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Then, later, as Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well\\nknown, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buy\\nprivately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a\\nproducer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better\\noutcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a small\\nbase while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.\\n</p>\\n<p>Did Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widened\\narea for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skills.\\n</p>\\n<p>Why did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything in\\nexchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.\\n</p>\\n<p>Why did Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire\\nshareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?\\n</p>\\n<p>Well, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the\\nequivalent of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdepartment of acquisitions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelpers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nsure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertise\\nwhile he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in business, aided by his long\\nexperience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than most\\nothers, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten years\\nin control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, for\\na net gain of one.\\n</p>\\n<p>What were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common,\\nalmost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure to\\nwork out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net worth would now be at\\nleast $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtually\\nsure things.\\n</p>\\n<p>The next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett\\nwere soon to depart.\\n</p>\\n<p>The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable\\ncompetitive advantage.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new\\nfixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbolt-on\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquisitions.\\n</p>\\n<p>Provided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present\\nis so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if\\n(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never again\\npurchased a large business.\\n</p>\\n<p>But, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof only moderate ability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For\\ninstance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworld-class.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorld-leading\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better business\\nexecutive than Buffett.\\n</p>\\n<p>And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire\\nmuch change in the Berkshire system.\\n</p>\\n<p>42</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '42': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Nor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure. With Berkshire now\\nso large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and that\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.\\n</p>\\n<p>My final task was to consider whether Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may\\nprove useful elsewhere.\\n</p>\\n<p>The answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large\\nand useful company.

In all other respects,\\nthe results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a\\ncorporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500\\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of\\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over),\\nper-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>During the first half of those years, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really\\ncounts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our\\nresources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax that\\nwould be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarked to market.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>By the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that\\ndiminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that apply\\nto controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carrying\\nvalue of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9closers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we own is written down, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwinners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are never revalued upwards.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had experience with both outcomes: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for the\\neconomic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nalso had some winners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a few of them very big \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but have not written those up by a penny.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap\\nbetween intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and growing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unrecorded gains at our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwinners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d make it\\nclear that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we would be delighted to repurchase\\nour shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfully\\nincrease per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continuing shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>The unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aggregate market-\\nvalue gain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tabulated on the facing page \\xe2\\x80\\x93 materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators vary\\nerratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however,\\nmarket-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares.

       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>The Year at Berkshire\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normalized earning\\npower to increase every year. (Actual year-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weakness\\nin the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains will\\nbe small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to better\\nearnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to\\ncustomers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital\\nexpenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual\\ndepreciation charge. It was money well spent.\\n</p>\\n<p>BNSF moves about 17% of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether\\ntransported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among the\\nseven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freight\\nthan our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to our\\nshippers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.\\n</p>\\n<p>For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings\\nweakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion*\\n(a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks and\\ndeserve yours.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 BNSF is the largest of our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPowerhouse Five,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy,\\nMarmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our five most profitable non-insurance\\nbusinesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003.\\nSubsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, we\\npaid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the\\nnumber outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire\\nby the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That\\nsatisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Next year, I will be discussing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPowerhouse Six.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPCC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectly\\ninto the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earning power.\\n</p>\\n<p>Under CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier supplier of aerospace components (most\\nof them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\naccomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkable\\nIsraeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinary\\nproducts that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.\\n</p>\\n<p>PCC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft.\\nOther industries are served as well by the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13\\ncountries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We look\\nforward to having him deploy Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of\\nour own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educate\\nme about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 they each handle about $9 billion for us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshire\\nin other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 101\\xe2\\x81\\x844 companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they\\nwere stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the 1\\xe2\\x81\\x844.) That leaves just under 98% of\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in\\n2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two that\\nearned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million,\\nsix that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and\\n$100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings as\\nthe years go by.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 When you hear talk about America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not talking about\\nBerkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed in\\nthe United States.\\n</p>\\n<p>I told you earlier about BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of every year, our railroad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nphysical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBHE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion in\\nrenewables and now owns 7% of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the\\n4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is six times the\\ngeneration of the runner-up utility.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables in\\nsupport of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, both\\nfor the environment and for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economics.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\nmakes 13 years in a row \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and increased its float. During those years, our float \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong\\nto us but that we can invest for Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neither\\nthat gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings, float generates significant investment\\nincome because of the assets it allows us to hold.\\n</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billion\\nearned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be replicated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on\\nacquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The cost\\nof these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.)\\nThese purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed\\nby our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, a\\ncombination we find highly appealing.

We follow different paths, however, in pursuing\\nthis goal.\\n</p>\\n<p>Their method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer an\\nopportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very promptly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to make the moves that will\\nget the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\neconomic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per working\\nhour \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the measure of productivity gains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporate\\nAmerica, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and his\\nassociates.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow\\nan approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by\\ncost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, our role is simply to create an environment in\\nwhich these CEOs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can maximize both\\ntheir managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs.

That may not sound impressive.\\nBut in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in real GDP per capita.\\n(Compounding\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.)\\nIn turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation.\\nWere that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four.

       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Intrinsic Business Value\\n</p>\\n<p>As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\\nis for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our\\n2010 annual report we laid out the three elements \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of them qualitative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that we believe are the keys to an\\nestimation of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased\\n8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nincluding insurance underwriting income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor\\nthe dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-counting\\nof value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortization\\nand minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax.\\n</p>\\n<p>I used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting\\nincome in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two quantitative pillars of\\nvaluation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nblow and the earth didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order to\\nbe conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break even\\nover time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.\\n</p>\\n<p>Today, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we\\nhave deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year,\\nour underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the second\\nparagraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and we\\nanticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year could\\nwell be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.\\n</p>\\n<p>Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our\\nearnings (including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is no\\ncoincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that of\\nour two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operating\\nearnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\\nincome characteristics from the others. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and\\nI view them (though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our\\nintent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being\\nthe reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cP/C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) branch of that industry has been the engine that\\nhas propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National\\nFire &amp; Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world,\\nas measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is far in excess of the value at which it is carried on our\\nbooks.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation\\naccidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies\\nholding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this\\nfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds\\nusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.\\nAnd how we have grown, as the following table shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2015 87,722\\n</p>\\n<p>Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized\\noperations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division, however, is party to\\na number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will be\\nvery gradual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can\\nnever be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This\\nstructure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic fortress. It will never be\\ncompromised.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss,\\nin effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance\\nindustry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal\\nreturns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest rates\\nthe world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many years\\nto come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good bet that industry results over the next ten\\nyears will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize in\\nreinsurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive\\nyears, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is\\nthe daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned\\nby poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament\\nstyle.\\n</p>\\n<p>So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value is calculated, the full amount of\\nour float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of\\nfloat as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims and\\nrelated expenses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that reduces float. Just as\\nsurely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.\\n</p>\\n<p>10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '10': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the\\ndoor tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\\n</p>\\n<p>A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asset that we incurred in buying our\\ninsurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid for\\nthe float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on\\nits true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill\\nasset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\\ninsurance goodwill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\\noperation possessing it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion we\\ncarry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our\\nfloat. Its value today is one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why we believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value\\nsubstantially exceeds its book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\\ndisciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\\n</p>\\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks\\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and,\\nmost important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that\\nare inappropriate in relation to our resources.\\n</p>\\n<p>Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a loss about triple anything\\nit has ever experienced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its\\nmany streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to write\\nbusiness in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers\\nwould be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\\n</p>\\n<p>When Ajit entered Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience in the\\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our\\nreinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions of\\nvalue for Berkshire shareholders.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually\\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both\\nprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate\\npremium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>11</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for\\nBerkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.\\n</p>\\n<p>Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\\n</p>\\n<p>We have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them\\nfrom our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined\\nfinancial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% of\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s after-tax operating earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\\nnot needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceed\\nits interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest coverage was\\nmore than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, not EBITDA/\\ninterest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\\n</p>\\n<p>At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to service its debt under all circumstances.\\nThe first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an\\nessential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-widening\\ndiversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. These\\nmany sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowed\\nBHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us and our\\ncustomers.\\n</p>\\n<p>All told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment to\\nkey components of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonable\\nreturns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\\nhuge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providers\\nin a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interest\\nto conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\\n</p>\\n<p>Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s average retail rate is\\n6.8\\xc2\\xa2 per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5\\xc2\\xa2. Here are the comparable industry\\nfigures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0\\xc2\\xa2, Missouri 9.3\\xc2\\xa2, Illinois 9.3\\xc2\\xa2, Minnesota 9.7\\xc2\\xa2. The national average is\\n10.4\\xc2\\xa2. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant\\ndifferences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a very crude measure,\\nhowever, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3\\xc2\\xa2 last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other four\\nmajor U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2\\xc2\\xa2 to 5.3\\xc2\\xa2.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no\\nstate comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of all\\nmegawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take that\\nfigure to 58% in 2017.)\\n</p>\\n<p>BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost\\n500 miles.

In contrast, the operating expense\\nfigures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of\\ncertain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers\\nmore accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do\\nGAAP figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain all of the adjustments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some are tiny and arcane \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but serious investors should understand\\nthe disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value.\\nFor software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recording\\ncharges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearly\\ndoes not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both,\\nthat is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though, from an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viewpoint, they\\ncould not differ more.\\n</p>\\n<p>15</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been\\ndeducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the rest not. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-real\\xe2\\x80\\x9d charges, once non-\\nexistent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real\\namortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.\\n</p>\\n<p>The table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We now\\nhave $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years.\\nEventually, of course, every dollar of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cassets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be charged off. When that happens, reported earnings\\nincrease even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)\\n</p>\\n<p>I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I do\\nthat, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are\\nall too real. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStock-based compensation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompensation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIf compensation isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t belong in the calculation of\\nearnings, where in the world do they belong?\\n</p>\\n<p>Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know any better. Or maybe they\\nfear losing \\xe2\\x80\\x9caccess\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is\\nplaying the game, why shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of\\npropagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.\\n</p>\\n<p>Depreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are at\\nBerkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in\\n51 years I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business falls\\nfar short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAP\\nearnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) When\\nCEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noses\\nlengthen while they speak.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however,\\nyou should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract something\\nto reflect BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inadequate depreciation charge.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging\\nfrom lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible\\nassets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others\\ngenerate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.\\n</p>\\n<p>A few, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 have very poor\\nreturns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the\\nindustry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled in\\nevaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit more\\nerrors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.\\n</p>\\n<p>Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average\\nof $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and\\nusing only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

While that was going on, I described this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoubling-up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d practice\\nas requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single security\\nbeing offered.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by\\nvolume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applications\\nwhile mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. Smooth\\nWall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable to\\nunderstand. (It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the more\\ncomplex structures. But rate them they did.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Barney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessed\\nthe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe one major weakness that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in the implementation was this decision\\nby the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Today, some legislators and\\ncommentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that of\\nthe ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving aside\\nthe few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay a\\nprice \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had to\\nforeclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>The average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but a\\ndaunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home \\xe2\\x80\\x93 take a look at the\\nhome we will have on display at our annual meeting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments that\\naverage $522.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths. Others will get over-\\nextended on credit cards and mishandle their finances. We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose his\\ndown payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental rates\\nfor comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their payment\\nbehavior during the Great Recession was far better than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people\\nearning multiples of our typical borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s income.\\n</p>\\n<p>The strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done well with our\\nmortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short-\\nterm fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us a\\nconstantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, which\\nbears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds and\\nfinanced the position in some short-term manner.)\\n</p>\\n<p>18</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however,\\nwe possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn\\nshort-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range.

At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing and\\nUrban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During the\\npast two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and its\\nmortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers\\n$704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year,\\n95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by the\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30.

       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Productivity and Prosperity\\n</p>\\n<p>Earlier, I told you how our partners at Kraft Heinz root out inefficiencies, thereby increasing output per\\nhour of employment. That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarkable gains in living\\nstandards since the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecret\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is appropriate: Too few\\nAmericans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look first at the\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most dramatic example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 farming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1900, America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of the\\ntotal, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to its\\nproduction and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.\\n</p>\\n<p>Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity\\nas planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn.\\nProductivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billion\\nbushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.\\n</p>\\n<p>Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been\\naccompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (\\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman input\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Today about three million\\npeople work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods have\\nallowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation of\\nhuman resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they\\nwould otherwise lack.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural\\ninnovations have been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anything\\nclose to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horses\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreater good\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must have rung hollow to farm hands who\\nlost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We will\\nexamine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.\\n</p>\\n<p>For the moment, however, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences\\nfor Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About\\n1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved by\\nClass I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only\\n187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-related\\nemployees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggering\\nimprovement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by\\n55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars.\\n</p>\\n<p>Another startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need\\nwell over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employment\\nwould raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s volume would actually move.)\\n</p>\\n<p>21</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '21': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Our own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, the\\nmerged company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000\\nemployees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees\\n(plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF has\\nimproved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen more\\nthan 50% to 0.95.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xb9 A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures cars\\nand their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the kind\\ndealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwriting\\nexpenses that consumed about 40\\xc2\\xa2 of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nseat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another when\\ncommissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nexcept for the consumer.\\n</p>\\n<p>And then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came up\\nwith the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. His\\nbaby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 moves that\\npermitted lower prices \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been the\\nrunaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with a\\ndirect distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwriting\\nexpenses of about 25%.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUSAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a mutual-like\\ncompany, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketing\\ninnovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as they\\nmoved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted the\\nsteady renewals that came from permanent residents.\\n</p>\\n<p>The direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by State\\nFarm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and Lillian\\nGoodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution model\\nbeyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated Government\\nEmployees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).\\n</p>\\n<p>Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did\\n$22.6 billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second\\nmouse gets the cheese.) GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAA\\nbeing the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA but\\nspends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)\\n</p>\\n<p>With the price advantage GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low costs allow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not surprising that several years ago the company\\nseized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm,\\nthough it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my 100th birthday \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I plan to announce\\nthat GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the\\nworkforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe,\\nhowever, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in direct\\nemployment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.\\n</p>\\n<p>22</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. In\\nfact, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csloppy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d operation could do just fine financially.\\n</p>\\n<p>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a\\nlevel that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that a\\nutility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\\nAnd some CEOs ran things accordingly.\\n</p>\\n<p>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is in\\nour country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makes\\nrenewables price-competitive in certain geographies. Those tax credits, or other government-mandated help\\nfor renewables, may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility, particularly if it is a high-cost\\noperator.

In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced\\n19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt-\\nhours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a period\\nduring which industry rates increased 44%.\\n</p>\\n<p>The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015\\ncompared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our\\npurchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year the\\nnumbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically,\\nwith the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE now\\nranks in the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top decile.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a\\nutility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliable\\noperation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paid\\na dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership.

Moreover, investors who\\ndiversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winning\\ninvestments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers.

They had no Plan B.\\n</p>\\n<p>The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.\\nAmericans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever be\\nemployed in farming.\\n</p>\\n<p>The solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to\\nwork but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformed\\nand expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) The\\nprice of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the\\nunfortunate.\\n</p>\\n<p>Important Risks\\n</p>\\n<p>We, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisk factors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in our 10-K. I\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section has helped me in evaluating a business.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because the identified risks aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known.\\nBeyond that, a 10-K\\xe2\\x80\\x99s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening event\\nactually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that will\\nonly surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financial problem for today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investor.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own array\\nof possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOs\\noften differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that may\\nresult from these possibilities.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, is\\ncertain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though not, in my view,\\nfor a long time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premium volume may shrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our\\nauto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for when\\npurchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storage\\ncapabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers and\\ncertain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but even\\nthe most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.\\n</p>\\n<p>None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term well-being. When we took over the\\ncompany in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe northern textile business in\\nwhich all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That development,\\nhowever, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.\\n</p>\\n<p>24</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '24': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing\\nworld. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect,\\nwe possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believe\\nthat Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve itemized above \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\nmany more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are\\npowerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuccessful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as defined by the\\naggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all\\nof American business.\\n</p>\\n<p>The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been more than 70\\nyears since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the first\\natomic bomb. Subsequently, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank our\\ngovernment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and luck! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for this result.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there is\\nonly one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in a\\ncentury is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps even\\nnations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increased\\nexponentially during my lifetime. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has its dark side.\\n</p>\\n<p>There is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S.\\nthat leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.\\n</p>\\n<p>No one knows what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe day after\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will look like. I think, however, that Einstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1949 appraisal remains\\napt: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and\\nstones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this\\nyear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might present\\nto our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.\\n</p>\\n<p>It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9chighly likely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nrather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccertain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexperts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nabout Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to\\nthe world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the\\ndanger.\\n</p>\\n<p>This issue bears a similarity to Pascal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued\\nthat if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because the\\nrewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance the\\nplanet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is\\nfoolhardy. Call this Noah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how\\ncloudless the skies appear.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by\\nclimate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property\\nlosses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or\\ntwenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced\\nannually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.\\n</p>\\n<p>25</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '25': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s average loss-per-policy\\nwas then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase\\nto about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans\\ninvolved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So,\\nparadoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had\\nremained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather than\\none doing $23 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather-\\nrelated events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years,\\nwhich is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nthough far from certain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 effect on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.\\n</p>\\n<p>As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a\\nlow-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major\\ninsurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Annual Meeting\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21st Century. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast\\nworldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m.\\nCentral Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30th. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with\\nmanagers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.\\n</p>\\n<p>This new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at\\nthe meeting. Last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling the\\nCenturyLink Center\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms at\\nthe adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stepped-up presence. Airbnb\\nwas especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we were\\npartners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look in\\noccasionally to make sure we hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come to\\nOmaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nlook that impressive when we were at our best.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume\\nenough Coke, See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fudge and See\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long ago\\nwe discovered a fundamental truth: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really hungry \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nand want to stay that way.\\n</p>\\n<p>Shareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 a.m. when the doors open at CenturyLink\\nCenter and start shopping. Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late last\\nmonth, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in those\\nwho work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entire\\nhome office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.\\n</p>\\n<p>26</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we try to issue\\nfinancial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We\\ndo not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating them\\ninstead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited means\\nwho trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars\\nwho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our\\nmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of\\nour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome runs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means as much to them as\\ntheir paycheck.\\n</p>\\n<p>Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\\ngroup efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federal\\nincome tax return \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns,\\nresponds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest\\nannual meeting, coordinates the Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities, fact-checks this letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the list goes on and on.\\n</p>\\n<p>They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with\\nthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&amp;A day with me.

That disconnect occurred because the\\naccounting rules (commonly referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGAAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that apply to companies we control differ in important ways\\nfrom those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesses we own requires that\\nthe carrying value of \\xe2\\x80\\x9closers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d be written down when their failures become apparent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWinners,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conversely, are\\nnever revalued upwards.\\n</p>\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliver\\nsurprises after the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill of\\ncompanies we acquired.

Actual earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of\\nperiodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specific\\nevents may occasionally reduce earnings at Berkshire, even when most American businesses are doing well.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our job, though, to over time deliver significant growth, bumpy or not. After all, as stewards of your\\ncapital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire ranked\\nfirst among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting many\\nbillions of dollars more than did the runner-up. Those reinvested dollars must earn their keep.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the\\ncash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to be\\nprepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, dark\\nclouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nimperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\\n</p>\\n<p>I earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment\\nactivities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nmaking small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketable\\nsecurities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for\\n$434 million in 1993. Dexter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase,\\ngiving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>That wreck was followed by three key happenings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two positive, one negative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that set us firmly on\\nour present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already own, a cash\\ntransaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business.\\nGEICO, with its almost unlimited potential, quickly became the centerpiece around which we built what I believe\\nis now the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier property/casualty business.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a boatload of\\nstock \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fine\\ninsurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares of\\nBerkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My error\\ncaused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 despite the Biblical\\nendorsement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).\\n</p>\\n<p>Early in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of MidAmerican Energy, a\\nbrilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable and\\nsocially-useful investments. The MidAmerican cash purchase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was learning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 firmly launched us on our\\npresent course of (1) continuing to build our insurance operation; (2) energetically acquiring large and diversified\\nnon-insurance businesses and (3) largely making our deals from internally-generated cash.

But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d suggest that\\nparticipants in this debate take a deep breath: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that complicated.\\n</p>\\n<p>From the standpoint of exiting shareholders, repurchases are always a plus. Though the day-to-day impact of\\nthese purchases is usually minuscule, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always better for a seller to have an additional buyer in the market.\\n</p>\\n<p>For continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price\\nbelow intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic\\nvalue. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is bought\\nout by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exiting\\npartner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies with\\ncorporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or\\nvalue-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.\\n</p>\\n<p>It is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above\\nwhich repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the case if a management was buying an outside\\nbusiness. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision.\\n</p>\\n<p>When CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seem\\noblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few owners\\nand were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not.\\n</p>\\n<p>It is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place,\\neven if the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money to\\nprotect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need for\\nfunds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting it\\nafter the needed expenditures are made.\\n</p>\\n<p>The second exception, less common, materializes when a business acquisition (or some other investment\\nopportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago,\\nBerkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. At our present size, the issue is far less likely to\\narise.\\n</p>\\n<p>My suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, join\\nhands and in unison declare, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is smart at one price is stupid at another.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>To recap Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own repurchase policy: I am authorized to buy large amounts of Berkshire shares at\\n120% or less of book value because our Board has concluded that purchases at that level clearly bring an instant and\\nmaterial benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount to\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value, a spread that is appropriate because calculations of intrinsic value can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be precise.\\n</p>\\n<p>The authorization given me does not mean that we will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d our stock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price at the 120% ratio. If\\nthat level is reached, we will instead attempt to blend a desire to make meaningful purchases at a value-creating\\nprice with a related goal of not over-influencing the market.\\n</p>\\n<p>To date, repurchasing our shares has proved hard to do. That may well be because we have been clear in\\ndescribing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value is\\nsignificantly higher than 120% of book value. If so, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. Charlie and I prefer to see Berkshire shares sell in\\na fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no\\nfun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances could\\ncreate a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders. If so, we will be\\nready to act.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>One final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people\\nhave come close to calling them un-American \\xe2\\x80\\x93 characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds\\nneeded for productive endeavors. That simply isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the case: Both American corporations and private investors\\nare today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not aware of any enticing project that in recent\\nyears has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now look at Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance.\\nThe property/casualty (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cP/C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since\\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &amp; Marine, for $8.6 million.\\nToday, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.\\n</p>\\n<p>One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive\\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos,\\npayments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large\\nsums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for\\ntheir own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds\\nusually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our\\nfloat. And how it has grown, as the following table shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2016 91,577\\n</p>\\n<p>We recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-time\\nboost, float at GEICO and several of our specialized operations is almost certain to grow at a good clip. National\\nIndemnity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whose float is certain\\nto drift downward.\\n</p>\\n<p>We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the outside no\\nmore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to\\nimmediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is by\\ndesign and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will never be\\ncompromised.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers\\nan underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we\\nenjoy the use of free money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so\\nvigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the\\ninsurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning\\nsubnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>8</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '8': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>This outcome is made more certain by the dramatically lower interest rates that now exist throughout the\\nworld. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though not those of Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are heavily\\nconcentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding a\\npittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good bet that industry\\nresults over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case of\\ncompanies that specialize in reinsurance.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, I very much like our own prospects. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unrivaled financial strength allows us far\\nmore flexibility in investing than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us\\nare always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, our\\nchoices expand.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\\nunderwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. That\\nrecord is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know\\nthat while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that\\nmessage lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\\n</p>\\n<p>So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value is calculated, the full amount\\nof our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to\\nthink of float as a typical liability is a major mistake. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we\\npay old claims and related expenses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that\\nreduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to\\nfloat.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this\\nliability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nbecause new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out\\nthe door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.\\n</p>\\n<p>A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoodwill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asset that we incurred in buying\\nour insurance companies and that is included in our book-value figure. In very large part, this goodwill represents\\nthe price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill,\\nhowever, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged\\nunderwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original\\ncost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our\\ninsurance goodwill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance\\noperation possessing it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion\\nwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion.\\nYet we have subsequently increased our float by $64 billion, a gain that in no way is reflected in our book value.\\nThis unrecorded asset is one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a huge reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why we believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic business value far\\nexceeds its book value.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running\\ndisciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the\\nmajor units.\\n</p>\\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures\\nrisks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed,\\ndecisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes\\nBerkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the\\ninsurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a loss about triple\\nanything it has ever experienced \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a large profit for the year. Our many\\nstreams of non-insurance earnings would see to that. Additionally, we would remain awash in cash and be eager\\nto write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and\\nreinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.\\n</p>\\n<p>When Ajit entered Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience in the\\ninsurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our\\nsmall and struggling reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created\\ntens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me\\nfor him, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hesitate. Make the trade!\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed until recently by Tad Montross. After\\n39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks.\\nKara Raiguel, who has worked with Ajit for 16 years, is now CEO of General Re.\\n</p>\\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure\\nactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit\\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the\\nappropriate premium can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be obtained.\\n</p>\\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn their back on\\nbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe other guy is doing it, so we must\\nas well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to that\\nnonsensical excuse for sloppy underwriting, and neither will Kara.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there is GEICO, the company that set my heart afire 66 years ago (and for which the flame still\\nburns). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 55 years of service in\\n2016.\\n</p>\\n<p>Tony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is no better\\nmanager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication and soundness to the job. (The latter\\nquality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unless he\\nthinks it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 180.) Like Ajit, Tony has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>On my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company\\nenjoyed over the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deserved to\\nsucceed. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual sales were then $8 million; In 2016, GEICO did that much business every three\\nhours of the year.\\n</p>\\n<p>Auto insurance is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and only a low-cost\\noperation can deliver those. In fact, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with\\nGEICO. So stop reading \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right now! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and go to geico.com or call 800-847-7536.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low costs create a moat \\xe2\\x80\\x93 an enduring one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that competitors are unable to cross. As a result,\\nthe company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up\\nfrom 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to\\n36,085.\\n</p>\\n<p>10</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Consequently, we assign them\\ntheir own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and\\nincome statement.

       "  '11': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets,\\nwith these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\\nin fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would\\nfar exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest\\ncoverage was more than 6:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to\\ninterest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\\n</p>\\n<p>At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to service its debt under all\\ncircumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these\\ncompanies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by few\\nother utilities: an ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by\\nany single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of the\\ncompany being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower\\ntheir cost of debt. That economic fact benefits both us and our customers.\\n</p>\\n<p>All told, BHE and BNSF invested $8.9 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment\\nto their segments of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise\\nreasonable returns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever\\nneed huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our\\nself-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they\\nrepresent.\\n</p>\\n<p>Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s average retail rate is\\n7.1\\xc2\\xa2 per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.9\\xc2\\xa2. Here are the comparable\\nindustry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0\\xc2\\xa2, Missouri 9.5\\xc2\\xa2, Illinois 9.2\\xc2\\xa2, Minnesota 10.0\\xc2\\xa2. The national\\naverage is 10.3\\xc2\\xa2. We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest. Our\\nrock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.\\n</p>\\n<p>At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of\\nsignificant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very\\ncrude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3\\xc2\\xa2 last year, while shipping costs for customers of the\\nother four major U.S.-based railroads ranged from 4\\xc2\\xa2 to 5\\xc2\\xa2.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no\\nstate comes close to rivaling Iowa, where last year the megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 55% of\\nall megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. New wind projects that are underway will take that figure\\nto 89% by 2020.\\n</p>\\n<p>Bargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large high-\\ntech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) and\\nbecause most tech CEOs are enthusiastic about using renewable energy. When it comes to wind energy, Iowa is\\nthe Saudi Arabia of America.\\n</p>\\n<p>BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight\\nalmost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads\\nalleviate highway congestion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier\\ntraffic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in a major way.\\n</p>\\n<p>12</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

In most cases, I was wrong when I originally sized up the economic characteristics of these companies or\\nthe industries in which they operate, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. In a couple of\\ninstances, I stumbled in assessing either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later put in place.\\nI will commit more errors; you can count on that.

They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite their\\nholding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital.\\n</p>\\n<p>Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price.\\nWe have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the\\nlarge figure we show on our balance sheet for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a\\ndecent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Absent a recession, earnings from the group will\\nlikely grow in 2017, in part because Duracell and Precision Castparts (both bought in 2016) will for the first time\\ncontribute a full year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings to this group. Additionally, Duracell incurred significant transitional costs in\\n2016 that will not recur.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually.

Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to an\\nevaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about\\nmany of our operations on pages 90 - 94. Be aware, though, that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the growth of the Berkshire forest that\\ncounts. It would be foolish to focus over-intently on any single tree.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>For several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does not\\nconform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rules\\nregarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periods\\naveraging about 19 years. In our opinion, most of those amortization \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpenses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are not truly an economic cost.\\nOur goal in diverging from GAAP in this section is to present the figures to you in a manner reflecting the way in\\nwhich Charlie and I view and analyze them.\\n</p>\\n<p>On page 54 we itemize $15.4 billion of intangibles that are yet to be amortized by annual charges to\\nearnings. (More intangibles to be amortized will be created as we make new acquisitions.) On that page, we show\\nthat the 2016 amortization charge to GAAP earnings was $1.5 billion, up $384 million from 2015. My judgment\\nis that about 20% of the 2016 charge is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>Eventually amortization charges fully write off the related asset. When that happens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most often at the\\n15-year mark \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlying\\neconomics of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business. (My gift to my successor.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Now that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less\\npleasant distortion produced by accounting rules. The subject this time is GAAP-prescribed depreciation charges,\\nwhich are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understate true\\neconomic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, when\\ninflation was rampant. As inflation subsided \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the inadequacy of\\ndepreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time, in the railroad industry,\\nwhere current costs for many depreciable items far outstrip historical costs. The inevitable result is that reported\\nearnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.\\n</p>\\n<p>15</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>At BNSF, to get down to particulars, our GAAP depreciation charge last year was $2.1 billion.

Owning only a northern\\ntextile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year at\\nBerkshire. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because there are always things that need to change in our hundreds of businesses. Last year, as\\nI mentioned earlier, we spent significant sums getting Duracell in shape for the decades ahead.\\n</p>\\n<p>We have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our\\nnormal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mention\\nit in my commentary. Indeed, when there is a total rebasing of a business, such as occurred when Kraft and Heinz\\nmerged, it is imperative that for several years the huge one-time costs of rationalizing the combined operations be\\nexplained clearly to owners. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved by\\nthe company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when\\nmanagement is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts and\\njournalists fall for this baloney.\\n</p>\\n<p>To say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstock-based compensation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that\\nroad are, in effect, saying to shareholders, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry\\nabout its effect on earnings. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll \\xe2\\x80\\x98adjust\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>To explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accounting\\nlaboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reported earnings.

Pay attention, too, as I explain\\nthat Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but uses\\nonly cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted all of these payments to\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executives as an expense.\\n</p>\\n<p>My accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these\\nBerkshire managers is tantamount to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and is therefore not a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expense.

Each is the leader in\\nits field.\\n</p>\\n<p>We also include Clayton Homes in this section. This company receives most of its revenue from the sale\\nof manufactured homes, but derives the bulk of its earnings from its large mortgage portfolio. Last year, Clayton\\nbecame America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new American\\nhomes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollar volume than Clayton because they sell site-built\\nhomes that command much higher prices.)\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in\\n2016, and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unit sales in 2017\\nand will likely deliver about 14% of its dollar volume.\\n</p>\\n<p>Even so, Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new\\nAmerican homes costing less than $150,000. Clayton manufactures close to one-half of the total. That is a far cry\\nfrom Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry in\\nunits sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is\\n14,677. And that number will increase in the future.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings in recent years have materially benefited from extraordinarily low interest rates. The\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years at\\ninception). But Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge,\\nClayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrow-\\nshort approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire is\\nalways asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidated earnings, even as they\\nhurt at Clayton.\\n</p>\\n<p>17</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '17': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Last year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its total\\nportfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers are usually lower-income\\nfamilies with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many,\\nsimilarly, have financial profiles that will be damaged by divorce or death to an extent that would not be typical\\nfor a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have a\\nstrong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587,\\nincluding the cost of insurance and property taxes.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular are\\nloan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had\\n$3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest or\\nfees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Our experience is that 93% of borrowers helped through these\\nprograms in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums on\\nforeclosures \\xe2\\x80\\x93 losses last year totaled $150 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our assistance programs end up helping Clayton as well as\\nits borrowers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clayton and Berkshire have been a wonderful partnership. Kevin Clayton came to us with a best-in-class\\nmanagement group and culture. Berkshire, in turn, provided unmatched staying power when the manufactured-\\nhome industry fell apart during the Great Recession. (As other lenders to the industry vanished, Clayton supplied\\ncredit not only to its own dealers but also to dealers who sold the products of its competitors.) At Berkshire, we\\nnever count on synergies when we acquire companies. Truly important ones, however, surfaced after our\\npurchase of Clayton.\\n</p>\\n<p>Marmon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s railcar business experienced a major slowdown in demand last year, which will cause\\nearnings to decline in 2017.

But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever.\\n</p>\\n<p>Confusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on\\npages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled\\nbusinesses, not marketable securities. This year I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners\\nunderstand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Before we leave this investment section, a few educational words about dividends and taxes: Berkshire,\\nlike most corporations, nets considerably more from a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capital\\ngains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains as\\nthe route to tax-favored returns.\\n</p>\\n<p>But here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the corporate math. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it\\n35 cents of federal income tax (and often state income tax as well). The tax on dividends received from domestic\\ncorporations, however, is consistently lower, though rates vary depending on the status of the recipient.\\n</p>\\n<p>20</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '20': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>For a non-insurance company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which describes Berkshire Hathaway, the parent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the federal tax rate is\\neffectively 101\\xe2\\x81\\x842 cents per $1 of dividends received. Furthermore, a non-insurance company that owns more than\\n20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to the\\nsubstantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company.\\n(The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid its\\nown corporate tax on the earnings being distributed.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance subsidiaries pay a tax rate on dividends that is somewhat higher than that applying\\nto non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualty\\ncompanies owe about 14% in taxes on most dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though, to about 11% if\\nthey own more than 20% of a U.S.-based investee.\\n</p>\\n<p>And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our tax lesson for today.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Bet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (or how your money finds its way to Wall Street)\\n</p>\\n<p>In this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and,\\nnext, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, a\\nunique establishment that played a role in the bet.\\n</p>\\n<p>Long Bets was seeded by Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization that\\nadministers just what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d guess: long-term bets. To participate, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproposers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d post a proposition at Longbets.org\\nthat will be proved right or wrong at a distant date. They then wait for a contrary-minded party to take the other\\nside of the bet. When a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoubter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d steps forward, each side names a charity that will be the beneficiary if its side\\nwins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.\\nWhen the bet is concluded, Long Bets pays off the winning charity.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here are examples of what you will find on Long Bets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 very interesting site:\\n</p>\\n<p>In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy 2029 no computer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98machine intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will\\nhave passed the Turing Test,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being.\\nInventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who will\\nwin this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie.\\n</p>\\n<p>That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers\\nby 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn\\nEric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He\\npromptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment,\\nshould we lose.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Now, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment\\nmanagement by professionals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in aggregate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved by\\nrank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelpers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would leave\\ntheir clients \\xe2\\x80\\x93 again in aggregate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index\\nfund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)\\n</p>\\n<p>21</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '21': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least\\nfive hedge funds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that would over an extended period match\\nthe performance of an unmanaged S&amp;P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet and\\nnamed a low-cost Vanguard S&amp;P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade of\\nfund managers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who could include their own fund as one of the five \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to come forth and defend their\\noccupation. After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting\\na little of their own money on the line?\\n</p>\\n<p>What followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managers\\nwho have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ted Seides \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nstepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 Partners, an asset manager that had raised money\\nfrom limited partners to form a fund-of-funds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.\\n</p>\\n<p>I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money where\\nhis mouth was. He has been both straight-forward with me and meticulous in supplying all the data that both he\\nand I have needed to monitor the bet.\\n</p>\\n<p>For Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 Partners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to be\\naveraged and compared against my Vanguard S&amp;P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money in\\nmore than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not be\\ndistorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.\\n</p>\\n<p>Each fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedge\\nfunds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlying\\nhedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fund\\nmanagers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here are the results for the first nine years of the bet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,\\nthe charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly opening\\nthe mail next January.\\n</p>\\n<p>Year\\nFund of\\nFunds A\\n</p>\\n<p>Fund of\\nFunds B\\n</p>\\n<p>Fund of\\nFunds C\\n</p>\\n<p>Fund of\\nFunds D\\n</p>\\n<p>Fund of\\nFunds E\\n</p>\\n<p>S&amp;P\\nIndex Fund\\n</p>\\n<p>2008 -16.5% -22.3% -21.3% -29.3% -30.1% -37.0%\\n2009 11.3% 14.5% 21.4% 16.5% 16.8% 26.6%\\n2010 5.9% 6.8% 13.3% 4.9% 11.9% 15.1%\\n2011 -6.3% -1.3% 5.9% -6.3% -2.8% 2.1%\\n2012 3.4% 9.6% 5.7% 6.2% 9.1% 16.0%\\n2013 10.5% 15.2% 8.8% 14.2% 14.4% 32.3%\\n2014 4.7% 4.0% 18.9% 0.7% -2.1% 13.6%\\n2015 1.6% 2.5% 5.4% 1.4% -5.0% 1.4%\\n2016 -2.9% 1.7% -1.4% 2.5% 4.4% 11.9%\\nGain to\\nDate 8.7% 28.3% 62.8% 2.9% 7.5% 85.4%\\n</p>\\n<p>Footnote: Under my agreement with Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 Partners, the names of these funds-of-funds have never\\nbeen publicly disclosed. I, however, see their annual audits.\\n</p>\\n<p>The compounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return that could easily\\nprove typical for the stock market over time. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for the\\nmarket over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds,\\nbecause many hold large \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshort\\xe2\\x80\\x9d positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stocks\\nwould have provided a tailwind for index funds.\\n</p>\\n<p>Instead we operated in what I would call a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneutral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d environment. In it, the five funds-of-funds\\ndelivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested in\\nthose funds would have gained $220,000. The index fund would meanwhile have gained $854,000.\\n</p>\\n<p>22</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '22': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Bear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a huge\\nfinancial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected were\\nsimilarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled to\\nperformance fees based on the results of the underlying funds.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But\\nthe results for their investors were dismal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 really dismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the\\nfunds and funds-of-funds involved \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fees that were totally unwarranted by performance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 were such that their\\nmanagers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. As Gordon Gekko might have\\nput it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFees never sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners that\\nlikely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2 and 20,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning a 2% annual fixed fee,\\npayable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by bad\\nones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to simply pile up assets under\\nmanagement has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performed\\npoorly.\\n</p>\\n<p>Still, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not through with fees. Remember, there were the fund-of-funds managers to be fed as well.\\nThese managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite the\\nterrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cperformance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 gulp! \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of all gains\\nachieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegotten\\nreward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could have\\neffortlessly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and with virtually no cost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 achieved on their own.\\n</p>\\n<p>In my opinion, the disappointing results for hedge-fund investors that this bet exposed are almost certain\\nto recur in the future. I laid out my reasons for that belief in a statement that was posted on the Long Bets website\\nwhen the bet commenced (and that is still posted there). Here is what I asserted:\\n</p>\\n<p>Over a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2017,\\nthe S&amp;P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance is\\nmeasured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.\\n</p>\\n<p>A lot of very smart people set out to do better than average in securities markets. Call them\\nactive investors.\\n</p>\\n<p>Their opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate their\\npositions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance of\\nthe universe\\xe2\\x80\\x94the active investors\\xe2\\x80\\x94must do about average as well. However, these\\ninvestors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costs\\nwill be worse than those of the passive investors.\\n</p>\\n<p>Costs skyrocket when large annual fees, large performance fees, and active trading costs are\\nall added to the active investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this cost\\nproblem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge funds\\nin which the funds of funds are invested.\\n</p>\\n<p>A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their\\nefforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on\\ninvestors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund\\nthan with a group of funds of funds.\\n</p>\\n<p>23</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '23': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>So that was my argument \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A (active investors)\\nand Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve average\\nresults before costs, so, too, must A. Whichever group has the lower costs will win. (The academic in me requires\\nme to mention that there is a very minor point \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not worth detailing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that slightly modifies this formulation.)\\nAnd if Group A has exorbitant costs, its shortfall will be substantial.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&amp;P over long\\nstretches. In my lifetime, though, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve identified \\xe2\\x80\\x93 early on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only ten or so professionals that I expected would\\naccomplish this feat.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are no doubt many hundreds of people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps thousands \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whom I have never met and whose\\nabilities would equal those of the people I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve identified. The job, after all, is not impossible. The problem simply\\nis that the great majority of managers who attempt to over-perform will fail. The probability is also very high that\\nthe person soliciting your funds will not be the exception who does well. Bill Ruane \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a truly wonderful human\\nbeing and a man whom I identified 60 years ago as almost certain to deliver superior investment returns over the\\nlong haul \\xe2\\x80\\x93 said it well: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to the\\nswarming incompetents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>Further complicating the search for the rare high-fee manager who is worth his or her pay is the fact that\\nsome investment professionals, just as some amateurs, will be lucky over short periods. If 1,000 managers make\\na market prediction at the beginning of a year, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nine\\nconsecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet.\\nBut there would remain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest with\\nhim.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a good\\nrecord quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investment\\nperformance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will nevertheless\\nseek new money because of their personal equation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely, the more funds they have under management, the\\nmore their fees.\\n</p>\\n<p>These three points are hardly new ground for me: In January 1966, when I was managing $44 million, I\\nwrote my limited partners: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to help\\nthem. This might not be true for my own personal results, but it is likely to be true for your results. Therefore, . . .\\nI intend to admit no additional partners to BPL. I have notified Susie that if we have any more children, it is up to\\nher to find some other partnership for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will\\nusually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick\\nwith low-cost index funds.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-\\ndown choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds.\\nIn his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers who have\\npromised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or, as in our bet, less than nothing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of\\nadded value.\\n</p>\\n<p>In his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today,\\nhowever, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their\\nsavings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the years, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nlearned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index\\nfund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\\n</p>\\n<p>24</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '24': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed\\nthat same advice when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and\\ndepart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another\\nbreed of hyper-helper called a consultant.\\n</p>\\n<p>That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients,\\nyear after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&amp;P 500? That would be career suicide. Large\\nfees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That\\nadvice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstyles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or current\\neconomic trends make the shift appropriate.\\n</p>\\n<p>The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,\\nentertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it.

This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is \\xe2\\x80\\x93on an\\nexpectancy basis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elite\\nfor superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.\\nFigure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money in\\nhedge funds ten years ago lagged S&amp;P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall is\\nconservative.\\n</p>\\n<p>Much of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds are\\nwoefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performance\\naccompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by local\\ntaxpayers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Human behavior won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change.

Those advisors who cleverly play to this\\nexpectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else.

Our target\\nwill again be the porch of a Clayton Home, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a\\nteenager \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in my one brief flirtation with honest labor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pretty\\ngood at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and\\nyou must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed). The competition will begin about 7:45, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take on\\nten or so competitors selected a few minutes earlier by my assistant, Deb Bosanek.\\n</p>\\n<p>Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\\nproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will be\\ncaptaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our companies.\\nYour children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the\\nmeeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire 5K,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an 8 a.m. race\\nstarting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guide that will be sent\\nto you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of\\nBerkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut\\nbrittle we eat throughout the Saturday meeting takes its toll.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us\\nset another record.\\n</p>\\n<p>26</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '26': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top counselors from\\naround the country. At last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 21% from 2015. I predict we will\\nbe up again this year.\\n</p>\\n<p>So stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually\\n8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point:\\nThe discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring\\nthe details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the\\nsavings on other Berkshire products.\\n</p>\\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among\\nthem a couple of new titles. The best book I read last year was Shoe Dog, by Nike\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Phil Knight. Phil is a very\\nwise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller. The Bookworm will have piles of Shoe\\nDog as well as several investment classics by Jack Bogle.\\n</p>\\n<p>The Bookworm will once again offer our history of the highlights (and lowlights) of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first 50\\nyears. Non-attendees of the meeting can find the book on eBay. Just type in: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\\nCelebrating 50 years of a Profitable Partnership (2nd Edition).\\n</p>\\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that airlines have\\nsometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though I must admit I have developed some tolerance,\\nbordering on enthusiasm, for that practice now that Berkshire has made large investments in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four\\nmajor carriers. Nevertheless, if you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs.\\nOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21/2 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you\\nsignificant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\\nagain be having \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must\\nmake your purchases between Tuesday, May 2nd and Monday, May 8th inclusive, and must also present your\\nmeeting credential. The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious\\nmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder\\nweekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d NFM\\nwill be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8\\np.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.\\n</p>\\n<p>This year we have good news for shareholders in the Kansas City and Dallas metro markets who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nattend the meeting or perhaps prefer the webcast. From May 2nd through May 8th, shareholders who present\\nmeeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such as brokerage statements) to their local\\nNFM store will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha store.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 5th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 7th, from 9\\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save\\n(or so my daughter tells me when we visit the store).\\n</p>\\n<p>27</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '27': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1st through Saturday, May 13th. During that period,\\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement\\nshowing you own our stock.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician and motivational\\nspeaker from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon\\nOsberg, two of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. If\\nthey suggest wagering on the game, change the subject. I will join them at some point and hope Ajit, Charlie and\\nBill Gates will do so also.\\n</p>\\n<p>My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I\\nmet Ariel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the\\nUnited States in the 2012 Olympics. Now, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a senior at Princeton (after interning last summer at JPMorgan\\nChase). If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates did\\npretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 7th, serving from 1 p.m.\\nuntil 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, call 402-551-3733 on April 3rd (but not before). Show you are a\\nsophisticated diner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their\\ne-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed at\\nloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of\\nthe New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\\n</p>\\n<p>From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most\\ninteresting and important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being\\nselected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no\\nmore than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like\\nyour name mentioned if your question is asked.)\\n</p>\\n<p>An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\\ninsurance specialist will be Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will\\ncome from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since what we\\nwill be conducting is a shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that\\nadd to our owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\\n</p>\\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be\\ntough, for sure, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed; we want to give as many\\nquestioners as possible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than\\nwhen you came and for you to have a good time while in Omaha.\\n</p>\\n<p>All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and\\nfor 18 from the audience. The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will\\ntake place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena\\nand main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.\\n</p>\\n<p>28</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '28': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>While I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the subject of our owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I\\nbelieve all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if\\npossible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we\\ntry to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a\\nSaturday (a day that also eases traffic and parking problems).\\n</p>\\n<p>We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or\\nanalysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the\\nshareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company\\nday-to-day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and as I write this letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly\\nAll-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the\\nmindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned\\ncompanies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome runs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means\\nas much to them as their paycheck.\\n</p>\\n<p>Equally important, however, are the men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This\\nteam efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,450-page Federal\\nincome tax return, oversees the filing of 3,580 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media\\ninquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nactivities, fact-checks this letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the list goes on and on.\\n</p>\\n<p>They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt\\nwith the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&amp;A day with me.\\nThey also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French\\nfries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. In addition, they cheerfully pitch in to help Carrie Sova \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nour talented ringmaster at the annual meeting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 deliver an interesting and entertaining weekend for our\\nshareholders. They are proud to work for Berkshire, and I am proud of them.\\n</p>\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a lucky guy, very fortunate in being surrounded by this excellent staff, a team of highly-talented\\noperating managers and a boardroom of very wise and experienced directors. Come to Omaha \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the cradle of\\ncapitalism \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on May 6th and meet the Berkshire Bunch. All of us look forward to seeing you.\\n</p>\\n<p>February 25, 2017 Warren E.

Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), per-\\nshare book value has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually.*\\n</p>\\n<p>The format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: A\\nlarge portion of our gain did not come from anything we accomplished at Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noperations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code.\\n(Details of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax-related gain appear on page K-32 and pages K-89 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 K-90.)\\n</p>\\n<p>After stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations. But,\\nin still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a generally accepted accounting\\nprinciple (GAAP) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that in future quarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net income figures and\\nvery often mislead commentators and investors.\\n</p>\\n<p>The new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be\\nincluded in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capricious\\nswings in our GAAP bottom-line. Berkshire owns $170 billion of marketable stocks (not including our shares of Kraft\\nHeinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period.\\nIncluding gyrations of that magnitude in reported net income will swamp the truly important numbers that describe our\\noperating performance. For analytical purposes, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbottom-line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be useless.\\n</p>\\n<p>The new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realized gains\\n(or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases,\\nwe have regularly warned you not to pay attention to these realized gains, because they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just like our unrealized gains\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 fluctuate randomly.\\n</p>\\n<p>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largely because we sell securities when that seems the intelligent thing to do, not because we are trying\\nto influence earnings in any way. As a result, we sometimes have reported substantial realized gains for a period when\\nour portfolio, overall, performed poorly (or the converse).\\n</p>\\n<p>*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500th of those\\nshown for the A shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>With the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying to\\nrealized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of our\\nnumbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaper\\nheadlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reports\\nsometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late on\\nFriday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysis\\nand give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday.\\nNevertheless, I expect considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is what\\nCharlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I focus on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we hope that you do, too. Our scorecard for 2017 follows.\\n</p>\\n<p>Acquisitions\\n</p>\\n<p>There are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-on\\nacquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our many\\nand varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, we\\nwill review 2017 acquisition activity.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths;\\nable and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business;\\nopportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price.\\n</p>\\n<p>That last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far\\nfrom spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic\\npurchasers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Why the purchasing frenzy? In part, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the CEO job self-selects for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan-do\\xe2\\x80\\x9d types. If Wall Street\\nanalysts or board members urge that brand of CEO to consider possible acquisitions, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit like telling your ripening\\nteenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.\\n</p>\\n<p>Once a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates\\nwill be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporate\\nsize. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask the barber whether you need a\\nhaircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large \\xe2\\x80\\x9csynergies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be\\nforecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint.\\n</p>\\n<p>The ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, even\\na high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate\\nacquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low and that to assign a large portion\\nof our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debt\\ndedicated to Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also never\\nfactor in, nor do we often find, synergies.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us\\nbelieve it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need. We held this view 50 years\\nago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold\\nit today after a million or so \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d have joined us at Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Despite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have\\nopportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the\\nprudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nWe were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot Flying\\n</p>\\n<p>J (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPFJ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading travel-center\\noperator.\\n</p>\\n<p>PFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Haslam began with a dream\\nand a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughout\\nNorth America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023;\\nHaslam family members will then own the remaining 20%. Berkshire is delighted to be their partner.\\n</p>\\n<p>When driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good.

Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here is\\n</p>\\n<p>an account, however, of a few larger purchases whose closings stretched between late 2016 and early 2018.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubled\\nour presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Oakwood Homes in Colorado and\\nHarris Doyle in Birmingham \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I expect our 2018 site built volume will exceed $1 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing.\\nIn 2017 Clayton sold 19,168 units through its own retail operation and wholesaled another 26,706 units to independent\\nretailers. All told, Clayton accounted for 49% of the manufactured-home market last year. That industry-leading share\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 about three times what our nearest competitor did \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year it\\njoined Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Both Clayton Homes and PFJ are based in Knoxville, where the Clayton and Haslam families have long been\\nfriends. Kevin Clayton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiring\\ncomments about the Haslam family to me, helped cement the PFJ deal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U.S. Floors (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUSF\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a rapidly\\ngrowing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gate\\nfast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear\\nthat we acquired both great human assets and business assets in making the USF purchase.\\n</p>\\n<p>Vance Bell, Shaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantially\\nstrengthened its position as an important and durable source of earnings for Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\xc5\\xa0 I have told you several times about HomeServices, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshire\\nbacked into this business in 2000 when we acquired a majority interest in MidAmerican Energy (now named Berkshire\\nHathaway Energy). MidAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid little\\nattention to HomeServices.\\n</p>\\n<p>5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>But, year-by-year, the company added brokers and, by the end of 2016, HomeServices was the second-largest\\nbrokerage operation in the country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however,\\nHomeServices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 growth exploded.

We\\nbegan by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With our\\npurchase we received $6.7 million of tangible net worth that, by the nature of the insurance business, we were able to\\ndeploy in marketable securities. It was easy to rearrange the portfolio into securities we would otherwise have owned at\\nBerkshire itself. In effect, we were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrading dollars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the net worth portion of the cost.\\n</p>\\n<p>The $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usually\\ndelivered an underwriting profit. Even more important, the insurance operation carried with it $19.4 million of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 money that belonged to others but was held by our two insurers.\\n</p>\\n<p>Ever since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends,\\ninterest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course,\\nare on our tab as well.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Float materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfront\\nwhereas losses occur over the life of the policy, usually a six-month or one-year period; (2) Though some losses, such\\nas car repairs, are quickly paid, others \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may take many years to\\nsurface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, of\\na person employed by one of our workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafter\\nrequiring expensive lifetime care.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '6': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Float generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines of\\nbusiness such as medical malpractice or product liability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 business labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9clong-tail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in industry jargon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\ngenerate far more float than, say, auto collision and homeowner policies, which require insurers to almost immediately\\nmake payments to claimants for needed repairs.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumbo\\nreinsurance policies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of our\\nemphasizing that sort of business, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth in float has been extraordinary. We are now the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second\\nlargest p/c company measured by premium volume and its leader, by far, in float.\\n</p>\\n<p>Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the record:\\n</p>\\n<p>(in $ millions)\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Premium Volume Float\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39 $ 39\\n1980 185 237\\n1990 582 1,632\\n2000 19,343 27,871\\n2010 30,749 65,832\\n2017 60,597 114,500\\n</p>\\n<p>Our 2017 volume was boosted by a huge deal in which we reinsured up to $20 billion of long-tail losses that\\nAIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record and one we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come close to\\nrepeating. Premium volume will therefore fall somewhat in 2018.\\n</p>\\n<p>Float will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we eventually experience a decline, it will\\nbe modest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrender\\noptions, p/c float can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t experience massive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cruns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in times of\\nwidespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investment\\ndecisions.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or even\\nthat of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked having\\nTreasury Bills \\xe2\\x80\\x93 loads of Treasury Bills \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines\\nor commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortably\\nwithstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\nThe downside of float is that it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. What looks predictable in insurance\\n</p>\\n<p>can be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. In\\nthe 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time,\\nthreatened to destroy its storied operation. (It has, I should add, fully recovered.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has\\nlong prioritized those qualities. That disciplined behavior has produced underwriting profits in most years, and in such\\ninstances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the\\nearlier table.\\n</p>\\n<p>I have warned you, however, that we have been fortunate in recent years and that the catastrophe-light period\\nthe industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significant\\nhurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.\\n</p>\\n<p>7</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '7': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>My guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure,\\nhowever, could be far off the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran\\nlow. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-graded\\nexam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfinancial condition for a very long time.\\n</p>\\n<p>We currently estimate Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion after\\ntax). If both that estimate and my industry estimate of $100 billion are close to accurate, our share of the industry loss\\nwas about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in future\\nAmerican mega-cats.\\n</p>\\n<p>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GAAP net worth\\nby less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worth\\nranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been far worse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a\\npath through Florida only a bit to the east, insured losses might well have been an additional $100 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>We believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insured\\nlosses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increases\\nover time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.\\n</p>\\n<p>No company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share\\nof such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insurance\\nactivities. Concurrently, much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 indeed, perhaps most \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleled\\nfinancial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and only Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when they, themselves,\\nneed to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.\\n</p>\\n<p>Prior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3\\nbillion pre-tax. I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years,\\nbut also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pre-tax from\\nunderwriting.\\n</p>\\n<p>A large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K at\\nthe back of this report. The only point I will add here is that you have some extraordinary managers working for you\\nat our various p/c operations. This is a business in which there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages.\\nWhat counts are brains and capital.

About 44% of the 2017 profit came from two\\nsubsidiaries. BNSF, our railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (of which we own 90.2%).

American investors pay staggering sums annually to\\nadvisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nworth? Indeed, again in the aggregate, do investors get anything for their outlays?\\n</p>\\n<p>Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfunds-of-funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that it expected to overperform\\nthe S&amp;P 500. That was not a small sample. Those five funds-of-funds in turn owned interests in more than 200 hedge\\nfunds.\\n</p>\\n<p>Essentially, Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts\\nwho, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. This\\nassemblage was an elite crew, loaded with brains, adrenaline and confidence.\\n</p>\\n<p>The managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and did \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rearrange\\ntheir portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while exiting their positions in hedge\\nfunds whose managers had lost their touch.\\n</p>\\n<p>Every actor on Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund\\nmanagers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally moves\\nupwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&amp;P 500\\nexceeded loss years.)\\n</p>\\n<p>Those performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the\\nfunds lost money for their investors during the decade, their managers could grow very rich. That would occur because\\nfixed fees averaging a staggering 21\\xe2\\x81\\x842% of assets or so were paid every year by the fund-of-funds\\xe2\\x80\\x99 investors, with part\\nof these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of the\\nunderlying hedge funds.\\n</p>\\n<p>11</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

At that\\nprice, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Given that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a really dumb \\xe2\\x80\\x93 investment compared to\\nAmerican equities. Over time, the S&amp;P 500 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which mirrors a huge cross-section of American business, appropriately\\nweighted by market value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has earned far more than 10% annually on shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equity (net worth).\\n</p>\\n<p>In November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cash return from dividends on the S&amp;P 500 was 21\\xe2\\x81\\x842%\\nannually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow.\\nBeyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use their\\nretained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would,\\nover time, substantially increase earnings-per-share.

Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 and I felt this possibility (which always exists) was very low. Two factors dictated this\\nconclusion: The reasonable price of Berkshire in late 2012, and the large asset build-up that was almost certain to occur\\nat Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate all risk to the\\ncharities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t produce at least $1 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Investing is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption\\nat a later date. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRisk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the possibility that this objective won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be attained.\\n</p>\\n<p>By that standard, purportedly \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisk-free\\xe2\\x80\\x9d long-term bonds in 2012 were a far riskier investment than a long-\\nterm investment in common stocks.

As an investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio\\nof U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible\\nmultiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.\\n</p>\\n<p>It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons \\xe2\\x80\\x93 among them, pension funds, college\\nendowments and savings-minded individuals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to measure their investment \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by their portfolio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ratio of bonds\\nto stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>A final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceasy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet,\\nthe 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and sell\\ndecisions. Most of those managers undoubtedly thought hard about their decisions, each of which they believed would\\nprove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journals\\nand conferred with Wall Street analysts.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

We simply decided to sell our bond investment at a price of more than 100 times earnings\\n(95.7 sale price/.88 yield), those being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that could not increase during the ensuing five years.\\n</p>\\n<p>We made the sale in order to move our money into a single security \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that, in turn, owned a\\ndiversified group of solid businesses.

The webcast will go live at 8:45 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Yahoo! will\\ninterview directors, managers, stockholders and celebrities before the meeting and during the lunch break. Both the\\ninterviews and meeting will be translated simultaneously into Mandarin.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our partnership with Yahoo! began in 2016 and shareholders have responded enthusiastically. Last year,\\nreal-time viewership increased 72% to about 3.1 million and replays of short segments totaled 17.1 million.\\n</p>\\n<p>For those attending the meeting in person, the doors at the CenturyLink will open at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday\\nto facilitate shopping prior to our shareholder movie, which begins at 8:30. The question-and-answer period will start\\nat 9:15 and run until 3:30, with a one-hour lunch break at noon. Finally, at 3:45 we will begin the formal shareholder\\nmeeting, which usually runs from 15 to 45 minutes. Shopping will end at 4:30.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Friday, May 4th, our Berkshire exhibitors at CenturyLink will be open from noon until 5 p.m. We added\\nthat extra shopping time in 2015, and serious shoppers love it. Last year about 12,000 people came through the doors\\nin the five hours we were open on Friday.\\n</p>\\n<p>Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which\\nproducts from dozens of our subsidiaries will be for sale. (Your Chairman discourages freebies.) Say hello to the many\\nBerkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that\\nsalutes all of our companies.\\n</p>\\n<p>Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting.\\nAfter you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our sixth annual \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire 5K,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an 8 a.m. race starting at the\\nCenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guide that will be sent to you with your\\nmeeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers,\\ndirectors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; even with Brooks running shoes, our times would be\\nembarrassing.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.\\n</p>\\n<p>A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top counselors from\\naround the country. At last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meeting, we set a record for policy sales, up 43% from 2016.\\n</p>\\n<p>So stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).\\nThis special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount\\nis not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of your\\nexisting insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on other Berkshire\\nproducts.\\n</p>\\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. This Omaha-based retailer will carry more than 40 books and DVDs, among\\nthem a couple of new titles. Berkshire shareholders are a bookseller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream: When Poor Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Almanack (yes,\\nour Charlie) made its debut some years ago, we sold 3,500 copies at the meeting. The book weighed 4.85 pounds. Do\\nthe math: Our shareholders left the building that day carrying about 81\\xe2\\x81\\x842 tons of Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wisdom.\\n</p>\\n<p>14</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '14': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\\ncredential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Keep in mind that most airlines\\nsubstantially increase prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying\\nto Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21\\xe2\\x81\\x842 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can\\nsave you significant money. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\\nagain be having \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make\\nyour purchases between Tuesday, May 1st and Monday, May 7th inclusive, and must also present your meeting\\ncredential. Last year, the one-week volume for the store was a staggering $44.6 million. Bricks and mortar are alive\\nand well at NFM.\\n</p>\\n<p>The period\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that\\nnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an\\nexception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerkshire Weekend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to\\n9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is\\nhosting a picnic to which you are all invited.\\n</p>\\n<p>NFM will again extend its shareholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discount offerings to our Kansas City and Dallas stores. From May\\n1st through May 7th, shareholders who present meeting credentials or other evidence of their Berkshire ownership (such\\nas brokerage statements) to those NFM stores will receive the same discounts enjoyed by those visiting the Omaha\\nstore.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\\nOn Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. Remember, the more you buy, the more you save (or so my daughter\\ntells me when we visit the store).\\n</p>\\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30th through Saturday, May 12th. During that period, please\\nidentify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing you\\nown our stock.\\n</p>\\n<p>On Sunday afternoon, on the upper level above Borsheims, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg,\\ntwo of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders. If they suggest wagering on the game,\\nchange the subject. Ajit, Charlie, Bill Gates and I will likely drop by as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met\\nAriel when she was nine, and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Ariel represented the United States\\nin the 2012 Olympics. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill\\nGates did pretty well playing Ariel last year, so he may be ready to again challenge her. (My advice: Bet on Ariel.) I\\nwill participate on an advisory basis only.\\n</p>\\n<p>Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6th, serving from 12 p.m. until\\n10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, call 402-551-3733 on April 2nd (but not before). Show you are a sophisticated\\ndiner by ordering the T-bone with hash browns.\\n</p>\\n<p>We will have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, asking\\nCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail\\naddresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed at\\nloomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of the\\nNew York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\\n</p>\\n<p>15</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '15': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\\nand important to shareholders. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you\\nkeep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two\\nquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned\\nif your question is asked.)\\n</p>\\n<p>An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the\\ninsurance specialist will be Gary Ransom of Dowling &amp; Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance\\noperations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Since\\nwhat we will be conducting is a shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meeting, our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions\\nthat add to our owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 understanding and knowledge of their investment.\\n</p>\\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough,\\nfor sure, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed; we want to give as many questioners as\\npossible a shot at us. Our goal is for you to leave the meeting knowing more about Berkshire than when you came and\\nfor you to have a good time while in Omaha.\\n</p>\\n<p>All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for\\n18 from the audience. After the 54th, all questions come from the audience. Charlie and I have often tackled more than\\n60 by 3:30.\\n</p>\\n<p>The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m.\\non the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will\\nhost, so to speak, a drawing.\\n</p>\\n<p>While I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the subject of our owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe\\nall shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, should\\nalso have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we try to\\nissue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday (a\\nday that also eases traffic and parking problems).\\n</p>\\n<p>We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts,\\ntreating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of\\nlimited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings. As I run the company day-to-day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and\\nas I write this letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is the shareholder whose image is in my mind.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars\\nwho run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our\\nmanagers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of\\nour managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome runs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means as much to them as their\\npaycheck.\\n</p>\\n<p>If managers (or directors) own Berkshire shares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and many do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from open-market purchases they\\nhave made or because they received shares when they sold their businesses to us. None, however, gets the upside of\\nownership without risking the downside. Our directors and managers stand in your shoes.\\n</p>\\n<p>We continue to have a wonderful group at headquarters. This team efficiently deals with a multitude of\\nSEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 32,700-page Federal income tax return, oversees the filing of 3,935\\nstate tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the\\ncountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities, fact-checks this letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the list goes on and\\non.\\n</p>\\n<p>16</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with\\nthe 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&amp;A day with me. They also\\nhandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered\\nin Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch.

If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply\\nto have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return,\\nbut would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.

       "  '2': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\\n</p>\\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGAAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from an\\nimpairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realized\\ncapital gains from the sale of investment securities and a $20.6 billion loss from a reduction in the amount of unrealized\\ncapital gains that existed in our investment holdings.\\n</p>\\n<p>A new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report,\\nneither Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us have\\nconsistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwild and\\ncapricious swings in our bottom line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n</p>\\n<p>The accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth\\nquarters, we reported GAAP losses of $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters, we\\nreported profits of $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses that\\nBerkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in all quarters. For the year, those earnings\\nexceeded their 2016 high of $17.6 billion by 41%.\\n</p>\\n<p>Wide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because our huge equity\\nportfolio \\xe2\\x80\\x93 valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2\\nbillion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourth\\nquarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9closs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of more than\\n$4 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying\\nthat in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them to\\ndeliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Long-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. For\\nnearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per-share book value. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnow time to abandon that practice.\\n</p>\\n<p>The fact is that the annual change in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which makes its farewell appearance on page\\n2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire has\\ngradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major value\\nresides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, while\\nour equity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be\\nincluded in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third, it\\nis likely that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place at\\nprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Each\\ntransaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causes\\nthe book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.\\n</p>\\n<p>3</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '3': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>In future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market price. Markets can be\\nextremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock price\\nwill provide the best measure of business performance.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Before moving on, I want to give you some good news \\xe2\\x80\\x93 really good news \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is not reflected in our\\nfinancial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in charge\\nof all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue.\\nBerkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents,\\nand Berkshire blood flows through their veins.\\n</p>\\n<p>Now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at what you own.\\n</p>\\n<p>Focus on the Forest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Forget the Trees\\n</p>\\n<p>Investors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our\\neconomic \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrees,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array of\\nspecimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade from\\nnow. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty.\\n</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nintrinsic business value. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because our forest contains five \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgroves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of major importance, each of which can be\\nappraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses and\\nfinancial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our huge and diverse insurance operation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 delivers great value\\nto Berkshire in a less obvious manner, one I will explain later in this letter.\\n</p>\\n<p>Before we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment\\nof your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part, that possess favorable and durable economic\\ncharacteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.\\n</p>\\n<p>Sometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes we\\nseek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Our two-pronged approach to\\nhuge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and, at times, gives us an important advantage.\\n</p>\\n<p>In recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for\\nour money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43\\nbillion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in which\\nwe invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forest remains the\\nmany dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with less\\nthan 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year. When we say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearned,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moreover, we are describing what\\nremains after all income taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based),\\nrestructuring expenses, depreciation, amortization and home-office overhead.\\n</p>\\n<p>That brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs.\\nToo often, their presentations feature \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadjusted EBITDA,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a measure that redefines \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to exclude a variety of\\nall-too-real costs.\\n</p>\\n<p>4</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '4': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>For example, managements sometimes assert that their company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock-based compensation shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\ncounted as an expense. (What else could it be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a gift from shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe\\nlast year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exact rearrangement won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nBerkshire has gone down that road dozens of times, and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.\\n</p>\\n<p>Abraham Lincoln once posed the question: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you call a dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nthen answered his own query: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour, because calling a tail a leg doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abe would have felt lonely on\\nWall Street.\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on page\\nK-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccosts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to GAAP earnings when we are evaluating\\nboth private businesses and marketable stocks.\\n</p>\\n<p>In contrast, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we need\\nto spend more than this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaintenance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall, Berkshire invested a record\\n$14.5 billion last year in plant, equipment and other fixed assets, with 89% of that spent in America.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownership\\nposition in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at yearend,\\nan amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation, federal income tax of about\\n$14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.\\nEventually, however, gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our investees paid us dividends of $3.8 billion last year, a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more important\\nthan the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies. Consider, as an\\nindicator, these figures that cover only our five largest holdings.\\n</p>\\n<p>Yearend\\nOwnership\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Share in $ millions of\\nCompany Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\\n</p>\\n<p>American Express 17.9% $ 237 $ 997\\nApple 5.4% 745 2,502\\nBank of America 9.5% 551 2,096\\nCoca-Cola 9.4% 624 (21)\\nWells Fargo 9.8% 809 1,263\\n</p>\\n<p>Total $2,966 $6,837\\n</p>\\n<p>(1) Based on current annual rate.\\n(2) Based on 2018 earnings minus common and preferred dividends paid.\\n</p>\\n<p>GAAP \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which dictates the earnings we report \\xe2\\x80\\x93 does not allow us to include the retained earnings of\\ninvestees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retained\\nby our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than one\\ndollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.\\n</p>\\n<p>All of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings to\\nrepurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock is underpriced, we rejoice\\nwhen management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership percentage.\\n</p>\\n<p>5</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '5': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holdings of American Express have remained\\nunchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because of\\nrepurchases made by the company. Last year, Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portion of the $6.9 billion earned by American Express was\\n$1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and shares\\noutstanding decrease, owners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually do well.\\n</p>\\n<p>A third category of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control with\\nother parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% of\\nBerkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J \\xe2\\x80\\x93 totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018.\\n</p>\\n<p>In our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents,\\nand another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to be\\nuntouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.\\nWe have also promised to avoid any activities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.\\n</p>\\n<p>Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of\\ncommission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, our\\nstock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.\\n</p>\\n<p>In the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will\\npermanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses\\npossessing decent long-term prospects.\\n</p>\\n<p>That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable\\nequities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the\\nyoung one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a\\nhuge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)\\n</p>\\n<p>My expectation of more stock purchases is not a market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will\\nbehave next week or next year. Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities. Our thinking, rather,\\nis focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>I believe Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value can be approximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden\\ngroves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.\\n</p>\\n<p>You may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur if\\nwe were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any of\\nour wonderful companies even if no tax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard to\\nfind. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>The interest cost on all of our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnon-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generated\\nfrom Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fifth grove \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a source\\nof financing that we expect to be cost-free \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or maybe even better than that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over time. We will explain the\\ncharacteristics of float later in this letter.\\n</p>\\n<p>Finally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value is maximized by our having assembled the\\nfive groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts of\\ncapital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantage\\nof tax efficiencies, and minimize overhead.\\n</p>\\n<p>At Berkshire, the whole is greater \\xe2\\x80\\x93 considerably greater \\xe2\\x80\\x93 than the sum of the parts.\\n</p>\\n<p>6</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",

Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-\\ndestructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs.\\n</p>\\n<p>When a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the\\ninformation they need to make an intelligent estimate of value.

We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled or\\ninadequately informed.\\n</p>\\n<p>Some sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments\\nthat they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There are\\nunquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.\\n</p>\\n<p>In addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for them or their families to become net\\nconsumers rather than continuing to build capital.

Our\\nlack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnumber\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to hit. Shunning the\\nuse of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers, reinforcing the culture we prize.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational,\\ninduced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations.

But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was\\nfar greater \\xe2\\x80\\x93 47% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of\\nthat year. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at why the impact was so dramatic.\\n</p>\\n<p>Begin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \\xe2\\x80\\x9cowns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an interest in Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nearnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Treasury Department holds a special class of our\\nstock \\xe2\\x80\\x93 call this holding the AA shares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that receives large \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdividends\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In\\n2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very well\\nwith its AA shares. Indeed, the Treasury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965, had evolved\\ninto a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.\\n</p>\\n<p>Last year, however, 40% of the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cownership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (14/35ths) was returned to Berkshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 free of\\ncharge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shareholders received a\\nmajor boost in the earnings attributable to their shares.\\n</p>\\n<p>This happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same\\ndynamic, moreover, enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.\\n</p>\\n<p>Those are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the tax\\nbenefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicable\\nto the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate has\\nlong been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however,\\nthe new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerably more valuable.\\n</p>\\n<p>Which suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses. Our two towering redwoods\\nin this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined, they earned $9.3 billion before tax\\nlast year, up 6% from 2017.

Today, National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured\\nby net worth.\\n</p>\\n<p>One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business model: P/C insurers receive\\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe\\nworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\\n</p>\\n<p>This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 money we call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual\\npolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to\\npremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following\\ntable shows:\\n</p>\\n<p>Year Float (in millions)*\\n</p>\\n<p>1970 $ 39\\n1980 237\\n1990 1,632\\n2000 27,871\\n2010 65,832\\n2018 122,732\\n</p>\\n<p>* Includes float arising from life, annuity and health insurance businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the outside no more\\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key\\ncomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\\n</p>\\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the\\nuse of free money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\\n</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\\nindeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss, in\\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry,\\ndespite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on\\ntangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility\\nin investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies. The many alternatives available to us are always\\nan advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained, our choices expand.\\n</p>\\n<p>Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\\nunderwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. For\\nthe entire 16-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27 billion, of which $2 billion was recorded in 2018.\\n</p>\\n<p>9</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '9': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\\nknow that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.\\nAt Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>In most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources \\xe2\\x80\\x93 debt and equity. At Berkshire, we have\\ntwo additional arrows in the quiver to talk about, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first address the conventional components.\\n</p>\\n<p>We use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that\\nsignificant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right most of the time.\\n</p>\\n<p>At rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-\\nroulette equation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 usually win, occasionally die \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upside but does not share in its downside.

The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and not guaranteed by Berkshire.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $349 billion is unmatched in corporate America.

Had we instead followed a 100%\\npayout policy, we would still be working with the $22 million with which we began fiscal 1965.\\n</p>\\n<p>Beyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of\\ncorporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge net\\nliability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because they\\nhave usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paid in most years for holding and\\nusing other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money.\\n</p>\\n<p>As I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in\\nassessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface.

At that time, GEICO, after a four-\\ndecade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. A\\nrecently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss costs and consequently underpriced its\\nproduct. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s books \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there were no less than\\n2.3 million of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would expire and could then be repriced. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s net worth in the meantime was rapidly\\napproaching zero.\\n</p>\\n<p>In 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concluded\\nthat he was the perfect man for the job, and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months, Berkshire\\nbought about 1\\xe2\\x81\\x843 of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly 1\\xe2\\x81\\x842 without our spending a dime. That stunning\\naccretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares.

Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9\\nmillion auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICO\\nthen ranked an undistinguished seventh.\\n</p>\\n<p>Late in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the\\ncompany for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Our\\noffer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful, but underdeveloped, company and an equally wonderful\\nCEO, who would move GEICO forward beyond my dreams.\\n</p>\\n<p>GEICO is now America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Number Two auto insurer, with sales 1,200% greater than it recorded in 1995.\\nUnderwriting profits have totaled $15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase, and float available for investment has\\ngrown from $2.5 billion to $22.1 billion.\\n</p>\\n<p>By my estimate, Tony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management of GEICO has increased Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intrinsic value by more than $50\\nbillion.

       "  '12': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Returns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under any\\ncircumstances. They are truly mind-blowing when compared against the return that many investors have accepted on\\nbonds over the last decade \\xe2\\x80\\x93 3% or less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.\\n</p>\\n<p>On occasion, a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become a\\npoor investment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period. Over time, however, investment performance\\nconverges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has been\\nextraordinary.\\n</p>\\n<p>The American Tailwind\\n</p>\\n<p>On March 11th, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business. The year was 1942, I was\\n11, and I went all in, investing $114.75 I had begun accumulating at age six. What I bought was three shares of Cities\\nService preferred stock. I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in\\n1788, a year prior to George Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined what\\ntheir new country would accomplish in only three 77-year lifetimes?\\n</p>\\n<p>During the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about\\n1\\xe2\\x81\\x842 of 1% of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population \\xe2\\x80\\x93 into the most powerful country on earth. In that spring of 1942, though, it faced\\na crisis: The U.S. and its allies were suffering heavy losses in a war that we had entered only three months earlier. Bad\\nnews arrived daily.\\n</p>\\n<p>Despite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11th that the war would be\\nwon. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed that\\ntheir children and generations beyond would live far better lives than they themselves had led.\\n</p>\\n<p>The nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride. It never had\\nbeen. Early in its history our country was tested by a Civil War that killed 4% of all American males and led President\\nLincoln to openly ponder whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In the 1930s, America\\nsuffered through the Great Depression, a punishing period of massive unemployment.\\n</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved\\nto be well-founded. In fact, the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievements can best be described as breathtaking.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund, and all\\ndividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (the\\nlatest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment\\nby a tax-free institution of that time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 say, a pension fund or college endowment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would have grown to about $5.3\\nbillion.\\n</p>\\n<p>Let me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid\\nonly 1% of assets annually to various \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelpers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have\\nbeen cut in half, to $2.65 billion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved\\nby the S&amp;P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.\\n</p>\\n<p>13</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
       "  '13': b'<div class=\"page\"><p></p>\\n<p>Those who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many\\nyears) might note that our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 40,000%! Suppose you had foreseen this increase and panicked at the prospect of runaway deficits and a\\nworthless currency. To \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprotect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d yourself, you might have eschewed stocks and opted instead to buy 31\\xe2\\x81\\x844 ounces of\\ngold with your $114.75.\\n</p>\\n<p>And what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,\\nless than 1% of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business. The\\nmagical metal was no match for the American mettle.\\n</p>\\n<p>Our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost unbelievable prosperity has been gained in a bipartisan manner. Since 1942, we have\\nhad seven Republican presidents and seven Democrats. In the years they served, the country contended at various times\\nwith a long period of viral inflation, a 21% prime rate, several controversial and costly wars, the resignation of a\\npresident, a pervasive collapse in home values, a paralyzing financial panic and a host of other problems. All\\nengendered scary headlines; all are now history.\\n</p>\\n<p>Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cathedral, lies buried within that London church.

Today, the Federal Reserve\\nestimates our household wealth at $108 trillion, an amount almost impossible to comprehend.\\n</p>\\n<p>Remember, earlier in this letter, how I described retained earnings as having been the key to Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nprosperity? So it has been with America. In the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accounting, the comparable item is labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9csavings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And\\nsave we have. If our forefathers had instead consumed all they produced, there would have been no investment, no\\nproductivity gains and no leap in living standards.\\n</p>\\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\\n</p>\\n<p>Charlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success has simply been a product of what I\\nthink should be called The American Tailwind. It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boast\\nthat they have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdone it alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The tidy rows of simple white crosses at Normandy should shame those who make\\nsuch claims.\\n</p>\\n<p>There are also many other countries around the world that have bright futures. About that, we should rejoice:\\nAmericans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant\\nsums across borders.\\n</p>\\n<p>Over the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by The\\nAmerican Tailwind. We are lucky \\xe2\\x80\\x93 gloriously lucky \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to have that force at our back.\\n</p>\\n<p>14</p>\\n<p></p>\\n</div>',\n",
