NLP analysis of Warren Buffett's annual letters.

For Milestone 1: The five notebooks are for 
1.) Scraping letters from website 
2.) Cleaning letters
3.) Exploratory Data Analysis from letters
4.) Comparison of different summary methods
5.) Topic Modelling

WIP: Continuation of cleaning data, adding possible Bert, XLNet models. Cleaning imports on Notebook 5 so that it links to the other notebooks / datasets.
